            <h4>Wireless Security</h4>
            <p>Wi-Fi technology standards are developed, promoted and certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance, a non-profit organisation consisting of hundreds of member 
            companies including technology manufacturers, service providers and network operators ensuring that all Wi-Fi devices interoperate seamlessly. 
            Companies certify their Wi-Fi-enabled products through this organisation, which runs stringent compliance and security testing. The IEEE has been 
            responsible for developing security standards for Wi-Fi technology. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the first such security standard, improved upon 
            through iterations of the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) standard. Despite improvements, all aforementioned standards have security vulnerabilities that 
            can be exploited by bad actors. In order to avoid compromisation, both individuals and companies need to use the latest security standards, use sophisticated
            passwords, and monitor for necessary security patches from device manufacturers.</p>

            <p>The WEP security standard is deprecated in favor of newer versions of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). Vulnerabilities include weak key 
            generation (encryption key can be deduced by short 24-bit initialization vector though statistical analysis), lack of authentication allowing 
            for man-in-the-middle attacks, weaknesses in the RC4 algorithm, as well as manual distribution of pre-shared keys.</p>
