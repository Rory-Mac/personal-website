<h4>TTL Logic</h4>
<p>The transistor allows for the control of the flow of current and voltage through a semiconductor. A semiconductor is a material with 
relatively moderate conductance, less than that of conductors, more than that of insulators. Electrical conductance is the reciprocal
of resistance, the more commonly used metric. The resistance of a material is defined as the ratio of the voltage across the material to 
the current passing through the material, \(R=\frac{V}{I}\).</p>
<p>Silicon is a semiconductor. A silicion atom has fourteen electrons, four of which are valent electrons, each of which form covalent bonds
with the valent electrons of other silicon atoms to create a stable lattice structure. The silicon lattice can be p-doped with a material 
with a lesser amount of valent electrons or n-doped with a material with a greater amount of valence electrons. In either case, doping 
increases the conductance of the semiconductive material.
