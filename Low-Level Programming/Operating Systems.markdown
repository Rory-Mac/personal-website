<h4>Operating Systems</h4>
<p>An operating system, simply put, is a process that manages processes on a computer architecture. A process is a runtime instance of a 
stored program. Responsibilites of the operating system include scheduling, providing hardware resources upon request, managing IO, 
privileges, software interrupts, virtual memory, caching and multithreading.</p>

<p>The kernel is the core of the operating system that is always resident in memory. The kernel includes a virtual memory manager that 
manages a page table. This is a tabular data structure that maps virtual memory to physical memory like above. The kernel typically also
manages a variety of kernel applications. Examples of kernel applications include device drivers, interrupt handlers, process schedulers,
kernel error detectors, power managers, syscall interfaces, etc.</p>
