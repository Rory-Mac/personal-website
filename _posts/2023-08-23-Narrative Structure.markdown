<h4>Narrative Structure</h4>
<p>This post documents my attempt to identify patterns in human narrative. Narratives are powerful in their ability to shape our perception of the world around us
and the actions we choose to take thereafter. Narratives are compressions of human experience. Thus, patterns in narrative reflect patterns in experience. Perhaps
the set of patterns that exist in human narrative form a structure, which maps to human experience. Such a structure would be a map of human narrative and experience.
We can define a narrative as a sequence of micro-narratives, i.e. "this was perceived, then this was perceived, ... then this was perceived." We can define a 
micro-narrative as the transition between two perceived environments, i.e. "this was perceived, then this was perceived." There is the perception itself, the human
experience, and then the telling of the perception, the narrative. The narrative filters the information contained within the experience based on a perceived importance.
Thus, we can consider human narrative as a compressed medium of human experience.

<p>We can imagine perception as a stream of information between environment and individual. The information is filtered by some mechanism, and compressed to form 
templates of experience. Perceived environments are associated with predictability if they reinforce the internal memory structure, and unpredictability if they 
build upon the internal memory structure. Agents perceive other agents, and learn to communicate, essentially creating experiential batch exchange through a
narrative medium.<img src="/Assets/images/narrative_network_throughput.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>All agents perceive pleasure, pain, predictability and unpredictability. All subsequent template-forming experiences extend these foremost templates. The 
structure beneath human narrative and experience would exist as the abstract memory structure derived from the set of all individual memory structures. These individual
memory structures form from internal narratives derived from the agent's perception of its environment. Similarly, we can imagine a collective memory structure that forms
from the perception of the set of all narratives being transmitted within the collective.</p>
