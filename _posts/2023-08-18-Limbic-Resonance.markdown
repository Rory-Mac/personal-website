<h4>Limbic Resonance</h4>
<p><b>Preface:</b> Limbic Resonance in popular culture refers to the idea that the capacity for sharing deep emotional states arises from
the limbic system of the brain. Limbic Resonance in this article refers instead to the degree to which a tool satisfies the
limbic system.</p>
<p>The limbic system is the area 
of the brain associated with emotionality and survival instincts, including food, reproduction, caring for young, and fight or flight. The
limbic system is comprised of the hippocampus, responsible for episodic memory, and the amygdala, responsible for emotionality and the
feelings of pleasure, fear, anxiety, and anger. Humans decide which tools to create and maintain across time, acting as a selective pressure.
Limbic resonance exists as the trait we select for. We will expend energy to construct and maintain the tools that maximally satiate our base
desires. As a simple example, the hammer and the nail, which we can use to transform wooden slats and planks into complex dwelling spaces,
indirectly enables us to feel safe rather than unsafe and cozy rather than vulnerable. Hence, it has survived across time. Tools will
be outcompeted by other tools since we humans select not just for the tools that successfully satiate our base desires, but for the tools that
maximally satiate our base desires. We can reason that a tool is of use if we can follow a causal chain from the tool back to our own 
personal satisfaction. Consider a bear in the forest, walking about in search of shelter until it stumbles across a nice looking cave. The
bear will not pay any attention to a hammer, no matter how much we might try to convince the bear of the hammer's utility. Reasoning about these
causal chains requires computation. Executive functions in the brain, such as abstract and spatial reasoning, which mostly take place in 
the prefrontal cortex, allow for the visualisation and enaction of these more complex causal pathways. These executive functions exist to 
maximise satiation in the long-term, and thus exist in eternal conflict with the limbic system, which instead wants to maximise
satiation in the short-term.</p>
<p>We can imagine that the exeutive functions of the brain themselves are nervous extensions of the limbic system: tools built by evolution
to satiate it across time. We can consider tools themselves as nervous extensions 
with bandwidth proportional to their limbic resonance. We build high bandwidth interfaces between ourselves and our tools, our cars, our laptops,
our phones, etc. A person who has lost their phone or has to go a weekend without Wi-Fi might behave as though they have Phantom Limb Syndrome.
The reliance of modern civilisation on digital computers, and the frequency with which we as individuals use them, is a consequence of their 
unprecedented level of limbic resonance. Prior to the advent of digital technology all computation was biological. Now, any computable
function (any set of rules defining how a set of inputs can be mapped to a set of outputs in a finite number of steps) can be outsourced
to a digital computer. Search engines satiate the limbic system's want for awareness of its environment through the acquisition of 
information relevant to a query, social networks satiate its want for social interaction, acceptance and esteem, pornography (which 
constitutes a single-digit percentage of internet traffic and a two-digit percentage of search traffic) satiates its want for sexual
stimulation, delivery services for foods and goods satiate hunger and a want for resource acquisition, the list goes on.</p>
<p>As radical a transformation as digital technology is, it may pale in comparison to the prospects of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Artificial Neural Networks act as universal function approximators, meaning that they can approximate any computable function, provided
enough inputs, outputs and computational resources. This means that we as humans do not even need to define the function we want computed in order 
to have a machine be able to compute it. Computational resources are not infinite however, so to allow for the feasibility of such
computation, we create specialised network architectures (CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs, etc.). The human nervous system acts as a blueprint for  
specialisation. It is the solution evolution arrived at by way of mutation and natural selection across billions of years. The consequences
of our collective attempt to reverse engineer the human brain are profound and numerous. Here are just a few possibilities we could consider:
<ul>
    <li>Robust Game-Playing Agents (to imitate our desire for exploration in valid, novel environments)</li>
    <li>Conversational AI companions directed at information acquisition (to satiate our desire for situational awareness and physical safety)</li>
    <li>Conversational AI companions directed at flirtation, play, and sociality (to satiate our desire for intimacy, acceptance, belonging and affection)</li>
    <li>Generative AI Models (to imitate human synthesis of experienced environments into abstract environments)</li>
    <li>Military Applications (to satiate our desire for control, physical safety, and esteem)</li>
    <li>Recommender Systems (to satiate our desire for novel stimuli)</li>
    <li>Inference trees derived from all human knowledge (to imitate the interplay between declarative memory and abstract reasoning)</li>
    <li>Global episodic memory for fictionalised perceptions of the world (to imitate episodic memory)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>One unit length of the causal pathway that relates a model to the limbic system it satiates can be thought of as one degree of 
separation. A companion AI RLHF'd directly onto a human user would be one degree of separation away from the user's
limbic system. A mechanical neural network used to dynamically improve the structural integrity of a bridge in response to changing environmental conditions,
which has greater longevity than its traditional counterpart, which increases the annual savings pocketed by the agency that built it, which
allows for reinvestment into the employees that made such a step forward possible, which better enables them to not only buy the goods and
services they need for themselves and their loved ones, but the goods and services they want, would
exist about four degrees of separation away from the satiated limbic systems. These causal pathways trace technologies back to the
desires that motivated their design. There is an exception to this rule however, which is the fact that the limbic system wants for novel stimuli.
This means that technologists will build technologies with no motivation beyond curiosity and no goal in mind other than exploration of the technology itself.
It seems AI development will follow the creation of super-intelligent specialised substructures of the human nervous system. This results from our collective attempt to reverse-engineer the 
brain, to discover the specialised neural structures that satiate our base desire, and replicate and extend these structures in digital
technology to create a digital overlay that targets not individuals, but the human collective. AI development will then be motivated to 
succesfully interconnect these components, as they are in the human nervous system. The ideal future is one in which the super-intelligent
nervous overlay that results from such development, exists symbiotically with the human collective.
But symbiosis requires bandwidth.</p>
<p>We are like monkeys with nuclear weapons. Our ability to context-switch to critical thought prevents our annihilation. Imagine an extreme bottleneck, where our primtive 
monkey-like limbic systems are divorced entirely from our executive functions. Say the monkey wants to throw a rock at its rival, and 
poses the unconscious question, "How can I guarantee maximum harm to my enemy", the executive function responds "well we could construct a
nuclear bomb to fulfill your wish, however..."; the monkey, thinking only in the short-term and not capable of contemplating the more 
complex causal pathways that concerns the cortex, overrides them, and revels in momentary delight before being vaporised. The healthier 
dynamic is one in which both systems can relinquish control to one another
at the appropriate time. Consider an engineer in a trance-like state of contemplation, visualising how components within a system slot
together and effect one another. The engineer's cortices are abuzz, auditory, visual, motor, etc, giving a visual sense of the system,
an auditory sense of componets buzzing, clicking and snapping together, and a proprioceptive sense of moving the components into different
configurations in space. The limbic system is essentially dormant until some environmental trigger reactivates it, although it does still 
encode the abstract contemplation into episodic memory for later retrieval. The reactivating trigger could be the engineer's hunger
at lunchbreak, exhaustion after the day's work, distraction when a colleague they fancy enters the room, etc.</p>
<p>We would want for a similar relationship to exist between our limbic system, our cortex, and our collective neural overlay. We do not want
to sit and wait while the overlay computes, we want to be along for the ride. Symbiosis can be achieved through high-bandwidth interfaces. 
Neuralink is the effort I'm most inspired by in this domain. The proof-of-concept of just one commercial BMI is enough. From there, economic 
and personal incentives for symbiosis will explode.</p>
