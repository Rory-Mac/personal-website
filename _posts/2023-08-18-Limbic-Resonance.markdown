<h4>Limbic Resonance</h4>
<p>In earlier blog posts I've touched upon the idea of artificial intelligence as the next step in the evolution of the our collective nervous system, an evolutionary
process that began with the advent of human language, and evolved with the written word, the printing press, telecomunnication networks, the internet, and now, 
artificial neural networks.</p>

<!--
What is limbic resonance?
How are ANNs different to all pre-existing tools?
What is the end-game, a fully super-intelligence, a set of partial general intelligences? Both? Robust Game-Playing agents versus large RLHF models?
The order of developing and combining components of the collective nervous system seems to be of great importance.
Exciting and scary, important as AI developers to keep this in mind.
