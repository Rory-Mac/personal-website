<h4>Existential Risk</h4>
<p>We've seen many a novel threat these past few years. Fires, floods and droughts seem more severe and widespread than can be recalled in recent memory<sup>[1]</sup>. 
Nuclear rhetoric has been exchanged between world powers in a way we haven't seen since the height of the cold war<sup>[2][3]</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 locked the world 
in economic and psychological stagnation for months on end<sup>[4]</sup>, and to make matters worse, the selective pressures exerted on media outlets seem to make the most provocative
news stories the ones most likely to survive and proliferate<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
<p>The average person is surprised to learn that by most metrics the world is getting better<sup>[6]</sup>. The global percentage population
of people living in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than $2.15 USD per day as of September 2022<sup>[7]</sup>, has decreased steadily from 75.65% 
to 10.01% (1800-2018)<sup>[8]</sup>. Global life expectancy has steadily risen from 28.4 years of age to 71.0 years of age (1770-2021)<sup>[9]</sup>. Global
literacy has inverted from 12.05% literacy and 87.95% illiteracy to 13.75% illiteracy and 86.25% literacy (1800-2016)<sup>[10]</sup>. The positive rates of change
these trends exhibit have not plateaued and are still in effect today. Even more shocking, is that child mortality rates across historical cultures 
averages to 48% prior to the 18th century, and has declined steadily towards today's global average of 4.3%<sup>[11]</sup>.</p>
<p>Technological innovation seems primarily responsible for these trends, motivating the evolution of agricultural practices, the invention of the printing press,
the steam engine, electricity, telecommunication networks, the internet, and the personal computer. All such technologies enable the individual to work closely with the 
knowledge of the human collective, to attain that which they desire. What is desired first and foremost, is sustenance and security for one's self and loved ones.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how far we advance as humans, an existential risk is an existential risk, meaning the risk bears with it the potential to bring us back to
square one. Risks we typically consider existential include nuclear holocaust, climate change, artificial intelligence and biological warfare. Existential in
this sense does not mean the extinction of the human species, as even in these worst-case scenarios the existence of a small percentage of survivors seems probable.
Instead it means the death of modern civilization, and with it the knowledge, technology, and culture we have accumulated and refined across centuries.
<p>Let us first ponder the likelihood of, and preventative measures against, nuclear existential risk, a risk that has come to the forefront of cultural influence as of
late<sup>[12]</sup>. An all-out exchange between nuclear powers would be realised either through an intentional first-strike, or a false retaliation. An intentional 
first-strike would have to be perceived as being in the best interests of the state that initiates such a launch. The principle of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)
along with prospects of nuclear winter, make such a perception unlikely. The only contingency where a first-strike could be perceived as being in the best interest of 
the state would be if the state perceived a first-strike from an aggressor as being imminent. This itself seems a stretch however, seeing as nuclear powers implement
Submarine-Launched-Ballistic-Missiles (SLBMs) along with ICBMs and nuclear bombers as part of a nuclear triad. These SLBMs are impervious to an aggressor's preventative
first-strike, thus negating any advantage that a first-strike would otherwise hold over a retaliatory strike. 
The second possible catalyst for nuclear holocaust is through false retaliation, where malfunctioning early detection systems give one nuclear power the false impression
that another has launched a nuclear strike against it. By the same principle of Mutually Assured Destruction along with second-strike capabilities, it seems improbable 
that such an event would motivate a misguided retaliation. It is in the best interest of the state to wait and confirm such an attack, and retaliate with second-strike
capabilities if necessary. Of course this assumes that the individuals responsible for making these decisions are rational actors, which may not hold true. A simple 
preventative measure against the irrationality of state actors is to ensure that the responsiblity of such decisions falls to a collection of individuals. Let us look
to nuclear close-calls across history, where cooler heads have thus far prevailed.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>5 November 1956</b>&emsp;During the Suez Crisis, NORAD misinterpreted collated reports of soviet activity as signalling an offensive towards NATO-allied
            France and the United Kingdom, giving thought to a nuclear first-strike against the Soviet Union. These collated reports were found to be a coincidental
            combination of events, which included a wedge of swans over Turkey being misidentified as fighter jets, a fighter escort for the Syrian President returning 
            from Moscow, scheduled soviet exercises and a British bomber that had been downed due to mechanical failure<sup>[14]</sup>. NATO enforces a principle of 
            collective defense under article five of its founding treaty. Despite this fact, the prospects of a nuclear exchange would give pause before more acute
            information came to light.  
        </li><br>
        <li><b> March 11, 1958</b>&emsp;A member of crew mistakenly pulled the emergency release pin on a nuclear-armed U.S Air Force B-47, dropping the nuclear-armed bomb
        into suburban South Carolina. A playhouse in the woods was destroyed from the conventional explosives, injuring two young sisters. Fortunately, the fissile core
        was stored elsewhere in the bomber. Had it not been, the resultant nuclear explosion could be perceived as the beginning of a first-strike<sup>[15]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>5 October 1960</b>&emsp;Radar equipment in Greenland used as an early detection system for NORAD misinterprets moonrise over Norway as a Soviet first-strike.
            The presence of Khrushchev in New York City as part of a UN delegation raises doubt as to the accuracy of the radar's readings<sup>[16]</sup>. 
        </li><br>
        <li><b>25 October 1962</b>&emsp;A bear climbing the security fence of Duluth Sector Direction Center was misinterpreted as military sabotage from a foreign agent.
        A fleet of nuclear-armed F-106A interceptors were dispatched, with pilots (who were told no practice drills would take place) believed that nuclear war had 
        started<sup>[17]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>27 October 1962</b>&emsp;The all too infamous soviet-patrol submarine B-59 mistook practice depth-charges from the US navy as a real attack, two of three 
        commanders ordered the use of a nuclear torpedo against the US Navy, though the order had to be unanimous. It was during this crisis that the families of 
        militiary and political elite were surreptitiously notified that the time to evacuate in fear of the possibility of nuclear war was now<sup>[18]</sup>. 
        </li><br>
        <li><b>9 November 1965</b>&emsp;Nuclear Bomb detectors used to distinguish the cause of power outages between mechanical failure and nuclear detonation, failed,
        giving the impression of a nuclear first-strike<sup>[19]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>23 May 1967</b>&emsp;A solar flare misinterpreted by early detection systems as an imminent strike caused the US military to come close to ordering 
        a nuclear-bomb counter-strike against the Soviet Union<sup>[20]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>9 November 1979</b>&emsp;Malfunctioning computer systems in NORAD headquaters across the United States caused alarm and full preparation against a 
        non-existent Soviet attack. NORAD briefed the national security advisor who briefed the president who was given three to seven minutes to make a decision.
        At the six to seven minute mark, satellite and radar systems confirmed the falsity of the reports<sup>[21]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>7 to 11 November 1983</b>&emsp;Able Archer, a NATO militiary operation used to simulate a joint response to the escalation of a conventional war into a 
        nuclear war, was misinterpreted by Soviet officials as a ruse disguising an imminent first-strike. Soviet ICBMS and nuclear-armed aircraft were brought to 
        the ready<sup>[22]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>25 January 1995</b>&emsp;A norwegian scientific research rocket was misinterpreted by russian radar systems as the launch of an ICBM directed at the russian 
        state. The russian nuclear briefcase was activated and nuclear submarines were put at the ready for a retaliatory strike<sup>[23]</sup>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>These historical close-calls suggest that of fundamental importance to the prevention of nuclear war is rationality and diplomacy, to act in opposition to the delusion
required to launch a first or retaliatory strike, and to recall that second-strike capabilities ensure that decision-makers can delay decisions without cost,
even in moments of high-pressure. More technologically advanced and reliable detection systems align with these principles, and include modern systems such as SBIRS, 
a constellation of infrared satellites deployed for the detection of missile launches to complement other ground-based radar networks and nuclear detonation detection
systems. The development of the Washington–Moscow Direct Communications Link, the Beijing–Washington hotline, the US Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, and the Russian
National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, also align with these principles and are of mutual benefit to all parties involved. On the diplomatic front, recognition and 
reinforcement of the phrase coined by Reagan and Gorbachev, that a "nuclear was cannot be won and must never be fought" is of great importance. Studies have suggested
that a nuclear war is likely to not only end civilisation, but with it the lives of five billion people<sup>[24]</sup>. This sentiment has been affirmed by a joint statement
made by The People’s Republic of China, the French Republic, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America,
as recent as January 2022<sup>[25]</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts however, nuclear war is still an existential risk, meaning that no matter how small the chance of its occurrence, the cumulative chance of its 
occurrence becomes an inevitability given a long enough time horizon. Informally this is referred to as Murphy's Law, that "anything that can happen, will happen". Given
that the chance of a nuclear exchange has not exponentially decreased since the advent of the nuclear age, this disturbing feature of probability remains.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/cumulative_probability2.png" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<p>Let us consider the cumulative probability of nuclear annihilation, assuming an annual percentage probability of 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%, over a 10 versus 30 versus 100 
year time horizon.

<p>It seems that to abolish rather than simply delay the existential risk associated with nuclear weapons, stockpiles would need to drop below the quantity required
to trigger the civilization-ending phenomenon of nuclear winter<sup>26</sup>, though could remain non-zero to enforce the principles of Mutually Assured Destruction.
Of course in the duration of this blog post I have focused solely on nuclear existential risk, and completely ignored prospects of artificial intelligence, climate
change, and biological warfare. Something else I have failed to mention, is that it doesn't seem of any importance for a civilian to be able to answer the question 
"how can the human collective resolve the existential risk imposed by \(x\)" where \(x\) is one such existential risk, if that civilian cannot determine how to convince
or motivate the human collective to do so. In these scenarios, how is the individual to act?</p>
<p>The individual will act, whether they have an existential-risk-derived policy or not, so it might be better to first simply ask how will the individual act? We can
say that the individual will take the action predicted to maximise a reward. It also seems to be the case that the set of desires motivating what is and is not perceived
as a reward is finite and relatively small, as it is the product of evolution and common to all individuals. What would these desires be? Homeostasis seems the foremost
one. Whether we like it or not our bodies will secrete hormones to keep a range of bodily factors in check. Insulin and Glucagon keep blood-sugar levels from being too
high or too low, Acetylcholine and Adrenaline will act on glands producing sweat to cool us down or keep us from losing moisture, melatonin will clock one's circadian
rhythm whilst norepinephrine will alert them to readiness. These are just a few autonomic processes that keep us functional and intact across time, with or without our
say. Of course these autonomic processes prove fruitless if we throw ourselves of a cliff, or into a river without knowing how to swim, so a more conscious desire for
physical safety also seems to exist in individuals. This is equivalent to the desire for health, for longevity, for self-preservation, etc. An individual will be very
uneasy if they are within close proximity to a lion, a snake, a coming earthquake or tsunami, or perhaps another human with a murderous glint in their eye. The actions
motivated by the desire for physical security will exist in tandem with the actions motivated by the desire for homeostasis. There does seem to be a distinction between
the human predator and the snake, because we can negotiate with the human more so than we can the snake. As social animals our actions are motivated by the desire for
social interaction. We will learn to speak, to appease, to encourage and to predict the patterns and behaviours of our cohort. This desire seems a bit harder to
pin-point, as social interaction has numerous undertones, from warmth and intimacy, to courting and reproduction, to esteem and social approval. 


</p>

<p>We know the individual will take the action they consciously or unconsciously predict will maximise that which is desired, by definition. 

 Across individuals there seems to be commonality between that which is desired.
Different actions and different justifications for actions, certainly, but the primary desires themselves seem to remain roughly consistent.
