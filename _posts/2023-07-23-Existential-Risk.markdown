<h4>Existential Risk</h4>
<p>These past few years we've seen many a novel threat. Fires, floods and droughts seem more severe and widespread than can be recalled in recent memory. 
Nuclear rhetoric has been exchanged between world powers in a way we haven't seen since the height of the cold war. A pandemic left the world locked in economic and
psychological stagnation for months on end. To make matters worse, the selective pressures exerted on media outlets (impression counts, sensationalist pieces, 
interest satiation of third party sponsors) make the most anxiety-provoking news stories seem the most likely to survive and proliferate.</p>
<p>It's no wonder therefore, that we are surprised to learn that by most metrics the world is getting better, not worse<sup>1</sup>. Percentage population living in 
extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than 2.15 US dollars as of September 2022<sup>2</sup>, has decreased steadily from 75.65% to 10.01% from the 
early 18th century to 2018<sup>3</sup>. Global life expectancy has steadily risen from 28.4 years of age to 71.0 years of age, from 1770 to 2021<sup>4</sup>. Global
literacy has inverted from 12.05 % literate and 87.95% illiterate in 1800 to 13.75% illiterate and 86.25% literate in 2016, again with a steadily positive gradient that
follows through to today<sup>5</sup>. Even more shocking, are findings from studying child mortality rates across cultures historically, from a running average of 48%
before the 18th century, to a steady decline that ends at a global average of 4.3% in 2020<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>Technological innovation seems primarily responsible for these trends. The evolution of agricultural practices, the printing press, the steam engine, electricity,
telecommunication networks, the internet, the personal computer, all these technologies enable the individual to work closely with the knowledge of the human collective
to attain that which is desired, which before anything is, is sustenance and security for ourselves and our loved ones.</p>
<p>There is a caveat to this optimisim of course, which is the fact that no matter how advanced we become, existential risks are existential risks, they are all or
nothing. With technology comes the power to create and destroy, and unfortunately a signficant portion of existential risk is man-made. The most significant existential
risks appear to be that of nuclear holocaust, climate change, and the geometric rise of artificial intelligence. It is important to note that when we say 
'Existential Risk', we aren't really saying the extinction of humankind, we are more so referring to the end of modern civilisation, and the return to the suffering
that permeated the pre-modern history of humans. Let us first look to the likelihood of nuclear holocaust, as well as preventative measures against its occurrence.</p>

This is the result of 
Poverty is down, life expectancy is up, renewable energy production is rising in an exponential fashion.
Hope for the future is thus warranted, that exploration and innovation could correlate with the expansion of consciousness in the universe. 
Existential Risks: Nuclear War.
What is the probability of nuclear war?
It seems relatively high. Why hasn't it happened?
