<h4>Existential Risk</h4>
<p>These past few years we've seen many a novel threat. Fires, floods and droughts seem more severe and widespread than can be recalled in recent memory. 
Nuclear rhetoric has been exchanged between world powers in a way we haven't seen since the height of the cold war. A pandemic left the world locked in economic and
psychological stagnation for months, and to make matters worse, the selective pressures exerted on media outlets seem to make the most provocative news stories
the ones most likely to survive and proliferate.</p>
<p>It's no wonder therefore, that we are surprised to learn that by most metrics the world is getting better, not worse<sup>1</sup>. The global percentage population
of people living in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than 2.15 US dollars as of September 2022<sup>2</sup>, has decreased steadily from 75.65% 
to 10.01% (from 1800 to 2018)<sup>3</sup>. Global life expectancy has steadily risen from 28.4 years of age to 71.0 years of age (1770 to 2021)<sup>4</sup>. Global
literacy has inverted from 12.05% literacy and 87.95% illiteracy to 13.75% illiteracy and 86.25% literacy (1800 to 2016). Note these trends show steady positive 
gradients that have not yet plateaued and are still in effect today<sup>5</sup>. Even more shocking, is that child mortality rates across historical cultures show a
running average of 48% prior to the 18th century, followed by a steady decline to the modern global average of 4.3% today<sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>Technological innovation seems primarily responsible for these trends. They have motivated the evolution of agricultural practices, the invention of the printing press,
the steam engine, electricity, telecommunication networks, the internet, and the personal computer. All such technologies enable the individual to work closely with the 
knowledge of the human collective, to attain that which is desired. What is desired first and foremost, is sustenance and security for ourselves and our loved ones.</p>
<p>There is a caveat to the optimisim these trends beget however. This is the fact that no matter how advanced we are as humans, an existential risk is an existential 
risk, bearing the potential to bring us back to the suffering of premodern times. Nuclear holocaust, climate change, the geometric rise of artificial intelligence, these
are all existential risks to be faced this century, birthed from the power technology gives us, to create and to destroy. It is important to note that when we say 
'Existential Risk', we aren't referring to the extinction of humankind, we are more so referring to the end of modern civilisation and a return to the suffering
that permeated the pre-modern history of humans.</p>
<p>This post will detail my ponderings of the first such existential risk, that is, the likelihood of, and preventative measures against, a nuclear holocaust.
There seem to be two avenues by which nuclear holocaust could be realised: the path of an intentional first-strike, and the path of a false retaliation. The former would
occur if decision-makers perceived a first-strike as being in the interest of the state, most likely in parallel to a runaway chain of military escalation. The latter
would occur from the malfunctioning of early detection systems giving the false impression of an imminent first-strike. Let us look at historical examples of an increased
probability of nuclear war, a movement towards rather than away from the brink of armageddon, to affirm these assumptions.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>5 November 1956</b>&emsp;During the Suez Crisis, NORAD misinterpreted collated reports of soviet activity as signalling an offensive towards NATO-allied France 
            and the United Kingdom, potentially necessitating a nuclear first-strike against the soviet Union. These collated reports were found to be a coincidental
            combination of events, which included a wedge of swans over Turkey being misidentified as fighter jets, a fighter escort for the Syrian President returning 
            from Moscow, scheduled soviet exercises and a British bomber that had been downed due to mechanical failure<sup>7</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b> March 11, 1958</b>&emsp;A member of crew mistakenly pulled the emergency release pin on a nuclear-armed U.S Air Force B-47, dropping the nuclear-armed bomb
        into suburban South Carolina. A playhouse in the woods was destroyed from the conventional explosives, injuring two young sisters. Fortunately the fissile core
        was stored elsewhere in the bomber. Had it not been, the nuclear detonation could have been perceived as the beginning of a first-strike<sup>8</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>5 October 1960</b>&emsp;Radar equipment in Greenland used as an early detection system for NORAD misinterprets moonrise over Norway as a Soviet first-strike.
            The presence of Khrushchev in New York City as part of a UN delegation raises doubt as to the efficacy of the radar's readings<sup>9</sup>. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>25 October 1962</b>&emsp;A bear climbing the security fence of Duluth Sector Direction Center was misinterpreted as militiary sabotage from a foreign agent.
        A fleet of nuclear-armed F-106A interceptors were dispatched, with pilots (who were told no practice drills would take place) believed that nuclear war had 
        started<sup>10</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>27 October 1962</b>&emsp;The all too infamous soviet-patrol submarine B-59 mistook practice depth-charges from the US navy as a real attack, two of three 
        commanders ordered the use of a nuclear torpedo against the US Navy, though the order had to be unanimous. It was during this crisis that the families of 
        militiary and political elite were surreptitiously notified that the time to evactuate in fear of the possibility of nuclear war was now<sup>11</sup>. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>9 November 1965</b>&emsp;Nuclear Bomb detectors used to distinguish a power outage as the result of mechanical failure from power outage as the result of
        nuclear detonation, failed, giving the impression of a nuclear first-strike<sup>12</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>23 May 1967</b>&emsp;A solar flare misinterpreted by early detection systems as an imminent strike caused the US militiary to come close to ordering 
        a nuclear-bomb counter-strike against the Soviet Union<sup>13</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>9 November 1979</b>&emsp;Malfunctioning computer systems in NORAD headquaters across the United States caused alarm and full preparation against a 
        non-existent Soviet attack. NORAD briefed the national security advisor who briefed the president who was given three to seven minutes to make a decision.
        At the six to seven minute mark, satellite and radar systems confirmed the falsity of the reports<sup>14</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>7 to 11 November 1983</b>&emsp;Able Archer, a NATO militiary operation used to simulate a joint response to the escalation of a conventional war into a 
        nuclear war, was misinterpreted by Soviet officials as a ruse disguising an imminent first-strike. Soviet ICBMS and nuclear-armed aircraft were brought to 
        the ready<sup>15</sup>.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>25 January 1995</b>&emsp;A norwegian scientific research rocket was misinterpreted by russian radar systems as the launch of an ICBM directed at the russian 
        state. The russian nuclear briefcase was activated and nuclear submarines were put at the ready for a retaliatory strike<sup>16</sup>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>These historical events seem to suggest that the moments that have lead us closest to the brink of nuclear holocaust have resulted from the false perception of 
an enemy's first-strike rather than consideration of the enaction of a first-strike itself. In the fog of war, when the president with the sole authority to 
initiate a nuclear first-strike is given just minutes to respond, possibly in the dead of night with no hope of consultation, we cannot be sure that rational thinking
will prevail as it has in the past.</p>
<p>Modern technological improvements have decreased the probability of false readings. Constellations of infrared satellites are now deployed for the detection of
missile launches (SBIRS) alongside ground-based radar networks and nuclear detonation detection systems (NDDS). Perhaps even more important, was the development of the
Washington–Moscow Direct Communications Link, the Beijing–Washington hotline, the US Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, and the Russian National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center.
Recognition by world leaders of the phrase coined by Reagan and Gorbachev, that a "nuclear was cannot be won and must never be fought" is perhaps an even more important
diplomatic development, realised by world scientists observing that a nuclear war is likely to end civilisation, along with the lives of five billion people<sup>17</sup>.
 This sentiment has been further affirmed by a joint statement made by The People’s Republic of China, the French
Republic, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, as recent as January 2022<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<p>One further note, hopefully in the mind of any president awoken to the threat of nuclear holocaust, is the fact that all major nuclear powers have retaliatory strike 
capabilities. This includes Russia, China, and the United States, all of which implement a Nuclear triad composed of one third Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles that 
are impervious to a preventative first-strike. This means that were the president to make no decisision against an imminent first strike, mutually assured destruction
would still apply to the sending party of the first-strike.</p>
<p>In all our discussion thus far, it seems to be the case that the rationality of individuals has been the most signficant preventative measure against nuclear holocaust.
However, the problem of cumulative probability remains. No matter how small the chance of nuclear war occurring, the chance becomes inevitable over a long enough time period,
assuming the change of occurrence is not decreasing at an exponential rate. It seems obvious that the chance of nuclear holocaust is not exponentially smaller today 
than it was decades past, and thus, this disturbing feature of probability remains.</p>
<p>Measures that exist to delay such an inevitably include traditional diplomacy, nuclear non-proliferation agreements, transparency and information exchange
between nuclear powers, etc. To abolish rather than simply delay nuclear existential risk, stockpiles need to drop below the quantity required to end civilisation,
but remain above the quantity needed to ensure deterrance. This number approximates one hundred per nuclear power <sup>19</sup>.
The New START agreement, which currently sets the limit on Russia and the United States' nuclear arsenals, is set to expire on the 5<sup>th</sup> February 2026.
It would be good to understand how bureaucracy prevents the hasty adoption of practices that are clearly in the best interests of humankind. Hopefully in a followup 
blog post I can explore exactly that.</p>
