title: Existential Risk

<h4>Existential Risk</h4>
<p>We've seen many a novel threat these past few years. Fires, floods and droughts seem more severe and widespread than can be recalled in recent memory<sup>[1]</sup>. 
Nuclear rhetoric has been exchanged between world powers in ways we haven't seen since the height of the cold war<sup>[2][3]</sup>. SARS-CoV-2 locked the world 
in economic and psychological stagnation for months on end<sup>[4]</sup>, and to make matters worse, the selective pressures exerted on media outlets seem to make the most provocative
news stories the ones most likely to survive and proliferate<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
<p>The average person is surprised to learn that by most metrics the world is getting better<sup>[6]</sup>. The global percentage population
of people living in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than $2.15 USD per day as of September 2022<sup>[7]</sup>, has decreased steadily from 75.65% 
to 10.01% (1800-2018)<sup>[8]</sup>. Global life expectancy has steadily risen from 28.4 years of age to 71.0 years of age (1770-2021)<sup>[9]</sup>. Global
literacy has inverted from 12.05% literacy and 87.95% illiteracy to 13.75% illiteracy and 86.25% literacy (1800-2016)<sup>[10]</sup>. The positive rates of change
these trends exhibit have not plateaued and are still in effect today. Even more suprising is the fact that child mortality rates across historical cultures 
averages to 48% prior to the 18th century, and has declined steadily towards today's global average of 4.3%<sup>[11]</sup>.</p>
<p>Technological innovation seems primarily responsible for these trends, motivating the evolution of agricultural practices, the invention of the printing press,
the steam engine, electricity, telecommunication networks, the internet, and the personal computer. All such technologies enable the individual to work closely with the 
knowledge of the human collective, to attain that which they desire. What is desired first and foremost, is sustenance and security for one's self and loved ones.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no matter how far we advance as humans, an existential risk is an existential risk, meaning the risk bears with it the potential to bring us back to
square one. Risks considered existential include nuclear holocaust, climate change, artificial intelligence and biological warfare. Existential in
this sense does not mean the extinction of the human species, as even in these worst-case scenarios the existence of a small percentage of survivors seems probable.
Instead it means the death of modern civilization, and with it the knowledge, technology, and culture that has developed across centuries.
<p>Let us first ponder the likelihood of, and preventative measures against, nuclear existential risk, a risk that has come to the forefront of our cultural imagination as of
late<sup>[12]</sup>. An all-out exchange between nuclear powers would be realised either through an intentional first-strike, or a false retaliation. An intentional 
first-strike would have to be perceived as being in the best interests of the state that initiates such a strike. The principle of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)
along with prospects of nuclear winter make such a perception seem unlikely. The only contingency where a first-strike could be perceived as being in the best interest of 
the state would be if the state perceived a first-strike from an aggressor as being imminent. This itself seems a stretch however, seeing as nuclear powers implement
Submarine-Launched-Ballistic-Missiles (SLBMs) along with ICBMs and nuclear bombers as part of a nuclear triad. These SLBMs are impervious to an aggressor's preventative
first-strike, thus negating any advantage that a first-strike would otherwise hold over a retaliatory strike. 
The second possible catalyst for nuclear holocaust is through false retaliation, where malfunctioning early detection systems give one nuclear power the false impression
that another has launched a first-strike against it. By the same principle of Mutually Assured Destruction along with second-strike capabilities, it seems improbable 
that such an event would motivate a misguided retaliation. It is in the best interest of the state to wait and confirm such an attack, and retaliate with second-strike
capabilities if necessary. Of course this assumes that the individuals responsible for making these decisions are rational actors, which may not hold true. A simple 
preventative measure against the irrationality of state actors is to ensure that the responsiblity of such decisions fall to a collection of elected officials rather than 
any one individual. Let us look to nuclear close-calls across history, where cooler heads have thus far prevailed, to verify these assumptions.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>5 November 1956</b>&nbsp;During the Suez Crisis, NORAD misinterpreted collated reports of soviet activity as signalling an offensive towards NATO-allied
            France and the United Kingdom, warranting the consideration of a nuclear first-strike against the Soviet Union. These collated reports were found to be a
            coincidental combination of events, which included a wedge of swans over Turkey being misidentified as fighter jets, a fighter escort for the Syrian President 
            returning from Moscow, scheduled soviet exercises, and a British bomber that had been downed due to mechanical failure<sup>[14]</sup>. NATO enforces a principle
            of collective defense under article five of its founding treaty. Despite this fact, it seems the prospects of a nuclear exchange would give pause to any leader,
            as was the case with the 2022 missile explosion in Poland[15][16].
        </li><br>
        <li><b> March 11, 1958</b>&nbsp;A member of crew mistakenly pulled the emergency release pin on a nuclear-armed U.S Air Force B-47, dropping the nuclear warhead
        into suburban South Carolina. A playhouse in the woods was destroyed from the conventional explosives, injuring two young sisters. Fortunately, the fissile core
        was stored elsewhere in the bomber<sup>[17]</sup>. Although this particular event does not itself pose an existential risk, it is a good example of the devastating
        consequences of faulty technology and human error with respect to nuclear warfare. 
        </li><br>
        <li><b>5 October 1960</b>&nbsp;Radar equipment in Greenland used as an early detection system for NORAD misinterprets moonrise over Norway as a Soviet first-strike.
            The presence of Khrushchev in New York City as part of a UN delegation raises doubt as to the accuracy of the radar's readings<sup>[18]</sup>. In these 
            scenarios of false positives we would hope that confidence in second-strike capabilities would allow rational leaders time enough to resolve these 
            misunderstandings.   
        </li><br>
        <li><b>25 October 1962</b>&nbsp;A bear climbing the security fence of Duluth Sector Direction Center was misinterpreted as military sabotage from a foreign agent.
        A fleet of nuclear-armed F-106A interceptors were dispatched, with pilots (who were told no practice drills would take place) believed that nuclear war had 
        started<sup>[19]</sup>. It took driving a truck into the take-off path of the departing jets to halt such an irrevocable escalation. Again, we were 
        drawn close to the brink of nuclear armageddon due to faulty technology and human error.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>27 October 1962</b>&nbsp;The all too infamous soviet-patrol submarine B-59 mistook practice depth-charges from the US navy as a real attack, two of three 
        commanders ordered the use of a nuclear torpedo against the US Navy, though the order had to be unanimous. It was during this crisis that the families of 
        militiary and political elite were surreptitiously notified that the time to evacuate in fear of the possibility of nuclear war was now<sup>[20]</sup>. It can be
        said diplomatic relations between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, as well as the rationality of one Vasili Arkhipov, were deciding factors in the prevention
        of the escalation of such a crisis into all-out war.  
        </li><br>
        <li><b>9 November 1965</b>&nbsp;Nuclear Bomb detectors used to distinguish the cause of power outages between mechanical failure and nuclear detonation, failed,
        giving the impression of a nuclear first-strike<sup>[21]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>23 May 1967</b>&nbsp;A solar flare misinterpreted by early detection systems as an imminent strike caused the US military to come close to ordering 
        a nuclear-bomber counter-strike against the Soviet Union<sup>[22]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>9 November 1979</b>&nbsp;Malfunctioning computer systems in NORAD headquaters across the United States caused alarm and full preparation against a 
        non-existent Soviet attack. NORAD briefed the national security advisor who briefed the president who was given three to seven minutes to make a decision.
        At the six to seven minute mark, satellite and radar systems confirmed the falsity of the reports<sup>[23]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>7 to 11 November 1983</b>&nbsp;Able Archer, a NATO militiary operation used to simulate a joint response to the escalation of a conventional war into a 
        nuclear war, was misinterpreted by Soviet officials as a ruse disguising an imminent first-strike. Soviet ICBMS and nuclear-armed aircraft were brought to 
        the ready<sup>[24]</sup>.
        </li><br>
        <li><b>25 January 1995</b>&nbsp;A norwegian scientific research rocket was misinterpreted by russian radar systems as the launch of an ICBM directed at the russian 
        state. The russian nuclear briefcase was activated and nuclear submarines were put at the ready for a retaliatory strike<sup>[25]</sup>.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>These historical close-calls suggest that of fundamental importance to the prevention of nuclear war is rationality and diplomacy, to act in opposition to the delusion
required to launch a first or retaliatory strike, and to recall that second-strike capabilities ensure that decision-makers can delay decisions without cost,
even in moments of high-pressure. More reliable detection systems help decrease the chance of such decisions ahving to be made. Modern systems such as SBIRS, 
a constellation of infrared satellites deployed for the detection of missile launches, help complement other ground-based radar networks and nuclear detonation detection
systems to decrease the impact of false readings. The development of the Washington–Moscow Direct Communications Link, the Beijing–Washington hotline, the US Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, and the Russian
National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, also align with these principles and are of mutual benefit to all parties involved. On the diplomatic front, recognition and 
reinforcement of the phrase coined by Reagan and Gorbachev, that a "nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought" is of great importance. This sentiment has been 
affirmed by a joint statement made by The People’s Republic of China, the French Republic, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
and the United States of America, as recent as January 2022<sup>[27]</sup>. The importance of such a diplomatic stance cannot be stressed enough, with studies estimating
that a nuclear war may not only end civilisation, but with it the lives of five billion people<sup>[26]</sup>.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts however, nuclear war is still an existential risk, meaning that no matter how small the chance of its occurrence, the cumulative chance of its 
occurrence becomes an inevitability given a long enough time horizon. Informally this is referred to as Murphy's Law, that "anything that can happen, will happen". Given
that the chance of a nuclear exchange has not exponentially decreased since the advent of the nuclear age, this disturbing feature of probability remains.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/cumulative_probability2.png" height="50%" width="50%"></p>
<p>Let us consider the cumulative probability of nuclear annihilation, assuming an annual percentage probability of 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%, over a 10 versus 30 versus 100 
year time horizon.

<p>It seems that to abolish rather than simply delay the existential risk associated with nuclear weapons, stockpiles would need to drop below the quantity required
to trigger the civilization-ending phenomenon of nuclear winter<sup>28</sup>. They could remain non-zero to enforce the principle of Mutually Assured Destruction, whilst
still abolishing their associative existential risk.
Of course in the duration of this blog post I have focused solely on nuclear existential risk, and completely ignored prospects of artificial intelligence, climate
change, and biological warfare, based on morbid curiosity alone. Something else I haven't yet addressed is that it doesn't seem to be of any importance for a civilian to
be capable of answering the question "how can the human collective resolve the existential risk imposed by \(x\)" where \(x\) is one such existential risk, if that civilian cannot determine how to convince
or motivate the human collective to do so. In these scenarios, how is the individual to act?</p>
<p>Its important to note that this hypothetical individual will act, with or without an existential-risk-derived policy, to maximise perceived reward as motivated by 
some reward function. Although the set of actions that could be taken seems near-infinite, the reward functions that motivate these actions seems finite and relatively small.
Homeostasis and physical safety first come to mind. All individuals act to keep their physiology healthy and intact, both autonomically via hormonal regulation and
through a self-preservation instinct. These unconscious motivations ensure that we as humans can regulate our temperature, our blood pressure, our sleep cycle, respond quickly
to accidentally touching a red-hot stove or move from a striking viper, and understand why throwing oneself off a cliff or into an ocean without knowing how to swim
is a bad strategy for long-term survival. Individuals that survive and reproduce also engage in social interaction based on some learnt strategy. This involves learning
to speak, to listen, to comprehend, and to predict the actions of others in their perceived environments such that we can do the same in ours. Such a reward function is
multi-faceted. Social interaction can exist as an umbrella term for the desire for warmth and intimacy, for courting and reproduction, for esteem and social approval, etc.
A point we have not considered is that even if our hypothetical individual were given an endless supply of sustenance, security and social interaction, they would still
want for some degree of novelty. Thus, it seems that exploration for exploration's sake motivates the behaviour of individuals, provided that the aforementioned desires
have been satiated. Abraham Maslow had these exact contemplations in his formulation of Maslow's Hiearchy<sup>29</sup>. In it he believed that self-actualisation existed
as yet another reward function, which came to the forefront if an only if all other needs had been met. Self-actualisation describes the desire to be as much as one can
be, to explore as much as one can explore, to master one's craft, to overcome adversity no human has overcome, etc. I like to use an alternative visualisation to
contemplate these reward functions.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/maslow_visualisation.png" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
<p>It is by no means an exact heuristic, but it seems helpful nonetheless. Take the set of nodes or a subset of the set of nodes and identify a path in the graph
that connects them all with minimal edges above or below the line. This arch diagram is equivalent to a flattened out complete graph, so essentially we are saying 
pick an \(n\)-gon in the graph that connects \(n\) nodes. We can think of one such \(n\)-gon as a narrative, that is a perceived environment the individual is acting
towards (reward, above the line) or away from (punishment, below the line). Prospect theory<sup>30</sup> seems relevant here, suggesting that humans are loss-averse
creatures who perceive loss and gain as being relative to a learnt baseline susceptible to change, rather than an absolute value derived from past experience. Thus, the
we can imagine that the individual perceives many narratives simultaneously, motivating its movement away from punishment and towards reward in order to maximise a
cumulative reward function across time. We can visualise multiple narratives motivated by the same base desires as a tunnel, with depth corresponding to distance in time.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/maslow_shapes.png" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
<p>Let's consider a simple example. A young student wishes to perform well on an academic test, as a proxy for an upcoming university admissions test, as a precondition to
an undergraduate degree, as a precursor to a job, to give a sense of financial security to satiate physiological, safety and esteem needs long into the future. These
narratives are sequential and stack atop one another. Returning to our initial consideration of existential risk, we can imagine such as a punishing 
narrative that requires collective rather than individual action to overcome. The individual can broadcast their concern
through the peer-to-peer network that is the human collective, assuming the majority of people share or are receptive to the same concern. The individual may feel a 
sense of despair watching these broadcasts propagate, simmer and die. Its necessary for the individual to act as an existence proof, to not only broadcast (which is 
also of benefit) but to take the set of actions that minimise the threat they perceive, in any small way they can. If we conclude that rationality and diplomacy are key
measures against nuclear existential risk, then we can strive to be diplomatic and rational in our own worlds and in our own relationships, to influence the social 
fabric in small, imperceptible ways that will propagate slowly but surely through from the local environment of approximately 150 individuals<sup>31</sup> to the global
environment of approximately eight billion individuals. Diplomacy and rationality are assisted by the heuristic of Graham's Hierarchy<sup>32</sup>. Graham's
Hierarchy is a relatively straightforward hierarchical classification of arguments. The better the form of argument the higher its elevation in the heuristic.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/Graham&apos;s_Hierarchy.png" height="100%" width="100%"></p>
<p>For any individual wanting for a more predictable and productive world, this seems a good principle to practice, a good standard to hold oneself to, and a good example
to set. The imperceptible effects that would propagate through the human collective from just one individual doing so could be enough to change the world for better or worse,
and in all likelihood, that individual is you.</p>
