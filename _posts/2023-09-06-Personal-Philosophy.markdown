<h4>Personal Philosophy</h4>
<p>My current personal philosophy which I devised about twenty minutes ago, is as follows.
<p style="margin-left: 20%">
<i>I want to be in love at the end of the world.<br>
Love is given, absent, sort after, and found.<br>
It is never found in the place expected,<br> 
and only found beyond a struggle that ends you.
</i></p>
<p>These words themselves seem to exist within the meaning they portray. They are like a messenger, a guidance,
an unexpected gift. They might soon be forgotten, I might wake up tomorrow and think them pretentious. In any case,
I hope they stay with me for a while. They give me a sense of solace, and a sense of where to head. A visual
representation of the same sentiment:</p>
