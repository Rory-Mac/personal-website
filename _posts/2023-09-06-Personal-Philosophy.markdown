<h4>Personal Philosophy</h4>
<p>My current personal philosophy which I devised about twenty minutes ago, is as follows.
<p style="margin-left: 20%">
<i>I want to be in love at the end of the world.<br>
Love is given, absent, sort after, and found.<br>
It is never found in the place expected,<br> 
and only found beyond a struggle that ends you.
</i></p>
<p>These words themselves seem to exist within the meaning they portray, like a messenger, a guidance,
an unexpected gift. They might soon be forgotten, I might wake up tomorrow and think them pretentious. In any case,
I hope they stay with me for a while. They give me a sense of solace, and a sense of where to head. A visual
representation of the same sentiment:</p>

<p>We cannot time our path-making decisions in accordance with the event horizon, because we do not know when the end will be. As we 
traverse through the intermediate graph between beginning and end, we discover save-points, points of contentment, where if the world were
to end, we would have won. Such a save point could be the vision of a tunnel of light in a serious car crash, a lover's embrace
as a planet-killing asteroid reaches its moment of impact, the resurfacing of a memory of home and of a mother's warmth as one fades
from consciousness, tears in rain, one's last words, or one's last message. Whenever the world doesn't end, we keep going, and when it does,
we find one last save-point, and exit.</p>
