title: Knowledge and Ideology

<h4>Knowledge and Ideology</h4>
<p>Knowledge is a hard thing to define. A pragmatic approach is to understand knowledge as perceived networks of causation, 
and verify this understanding through application to machine learning. We can start with markov decision processes, a concept
concerning agents that perceive external environments in sequence and take formulaic actions to perceive a sequence that maximises a pre-determined
reward function. We can then say that causation networks are built atop this, either unconsciously through nerual processing, or consciously
by way of the scientific method. The below diagram shows the idea of how causal diagrams might be formed from the perceptual experience of
a markov agent.</p>

<p>The causal networks resulting from such a rule set and some perceptual experience may have a high or low degree of correlation versus
causation. Causal networks established via the exploration of formal logic will likely have a high degree of causation, whilst those 
established via the exploration of geopolitics will likely have a high degree of correlation. We could think of this as a ratio between
memory used for the storage of perceptual experience and memory used for the storage of rules of inference. Another way to think about this
is that the discussion of formal logic requires a small formal alphabet, whilst the discussion of geopolitics requires the complexity of
natural language, to describe both the historical evidence in making a claim, and justification for why such evidence relates to the claim.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/qualitative_quantitative_inquiry.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>More abstract heuristics of quantitiatve and qualitiative investigation seem to fall back on these simpler models of perception and 
causation mapping. In the case of the scientific method, of quantitative inquiry, a phenomenon is observed, a hypothesis as to the cause of
the phenomenon is made, the phenomenon is recreated via an experimental test but in the absence of factors outside the hypothesis, the 
result is interpreted, a conclusion is made, affirming or denying the hypothesis, and integrating the hypothesis into the knowledge base
composed of the findings of previous scientific inquiries. This seems equivalent to our early exploration of causal 
diagrams. We can reframe the scientific method as observation of a state-transition, hypothesis of a cause-effect relation, recreation of
hypothesised cause in absence of external factors, observation or non-observation of effect, incorporation into inference tree constructred
from previous observations and rules of inference. Similarly, for qualitative investigation, knowledge seems akin to a memory structure 
storing experiences perceived and assumptions held to be true, epistemology seems akin to correlative associations made within the memory
structure, methodology seems akin to an inference ruleset and method the application of the ruleset in a particular context, whilst data
analysis, like before, is integration of the findings bakc into the memory structure.</p> 
<p>As humans in the real world, the reward functions motivating our actions are numerous, diluting the amount of energy we can spend on 
developing any one causal network. Consider that a part of our neural circuitry is motivated to find cause-effect relations in words 
spoken and positive social signalling received, especially if we are close to an individual who we need to appease for our own security.
Another part of our neural circuitry finds causal relations between desires others possess and actions they take, for the purpose of 
prediction and imitation, especially in early development. Every individual has a unique causal network by which they interpret their 
world, drawn from personal experience, which we can refer to as personal ideology, which exists as a combination of collective ideologies,
that is aspects of systems of ideas people have through which they view the world. There exists politicial ideology concerning governance
of a state, philosophical ideology concerning the nature of perceptual experience, economic ideology concerning the generation and 
distribution of wealth within a state, social ideology concerning the nature of relations between individuals within the state, etc. Some
ideologies align themself with one such category (capitalism and communism are economic in nature) whilst others align 
themselves with many (liberalism and conservatism are political, economic and social in nature). Heuristics exist that map out relations
between cultures and ideologies with admirable precision<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
<p>Of all the ideologies through which we could begin an analysis of the world at large, lets start with Realism. Realism is a school of
thought in international relations that holds the following assumptions as generally true:
<ul>State-centrism: international relations exists primarily as the result of the interaction between states, rather than the interaction
between leaders, institutions, or peoples.</ul>
<ul>Anarchy: thus the international political system is anarchic as no authority sits above all states and enforces rules.</ul>
<ul>Rationality: states are rational actors with self-interest.</ul>
<ul>Power: states desire states desire power to ensure self-preservation.</ul>
Realist thought is greatly influenced by geopolitical analysis, that is the study of the effect geography has over international relations,
how land and resources effect the establishment of and interaction between nations and their people. The rest of this post
will attempt to compile heuristics that help us see the world through a realist lens.</p>
<h4>The drawing and redrawing of historical lines</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective components of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. We as humans seek regions of 
abundance. Abundance gives us satiation in the short-term, through the availability of needed resources, and growth in the long-term,
by allowing energy to be expended on the discovery and development of new cultural and technological practices. The cradles of civilisation,
of which there are six, are the civilisations that emerged naturally from the developing practices of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. All
cradles of civilisation emerged in regions of abundance, and were characterised by agriculture, urban-dwellings, monument erection and use
of the written word. This includes Ancient Mesopotamia and the fertile crescent, Ancient Egypt and the Nile, Ancient India, the
Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra, Ancient China and the Yellow River, the Caral-Supe and the Fortaleza, the Pativilica and the Supe, and finally,
the Olmecs and the tropical lowlands of the gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>These river systems and coastal regions gave humans a reliable source of aquatic food, wildlife, and alluvial soil for agriculture. 
They also provided a means of transport, allowing humans to expand across a coast or river bank whilst maintaining a communal identity 
through frequent trade and travel. Other candidates for early civilisation may never have been realised due to a number of preventative
factors, including geographic isolation, harsh ecologies and temperamental climates (discouraging labor-intensive agricultural practice),
mountainous topographies (causing low population density that discourages urbanisation), and regions of frequent natural disaster.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/compounding_culture.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>Within these cradles of civilisation, cultural knowledge grew exponentially with respect to the number of generations for
which the knowledge was preserved, inherited and extended upon. The Sumerians of Ancient Mesopotamia developed the wheel, the sail, 
irrigation techniques, cuneiform literature, ziggurat temples, and social stratification (upper, middle, lower and enslaved). The Ancient
Egyptians, used pulleys, ramps and levers, developed papyrus paper, pottery
and rope trusses, and erected Abu Simbel, the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids. Despite the grandeur of these past cradles of civilisations, they, like all
others across human history, were subject to atrophy and strain in the form of war, plague, famine, and natural disaster.</p>
<p>The Three Kingdoms War of early China saw some 36 to 40 million people killed from conflict, famine and disease, approximately 20% of
the global population at the time<sup>[2][3][4]</sup>. The black death was estimated to have caused 75 to 200 million fatalities, and the plague of Justinian wiped
out 25%-60% of European inhabitants<sup>[5]</sup>. The Yellow River flood killed an estimated 2,000,000 people and the Bhola Cycle of East Pakistan/West
India an estimated 500,000 people<sup>[6]</sup></p>
<p>It is clear that human history has been shaped and punctuated by mass death and suffering across
nations and empires that form and stay bound through national, ethnic and religious identity. The fierceness of their competititon derives
from their military, industrial and political strength, making for a continual power struggle by which geographic lines are drawn and 
redrawn across history. With this, we arrive at our first heuristic: the natural world's geopolitical overlay, comprised of amoeboid like
nation-states<sup>[7][8]</sup> that rise and fall, spread and recede, fragment and combine.</p>
<h4>Structures of Governance</h4>
<p>A structure of governance, not unlike an organisational structure, is a structure that defines the way in which work and decision-making
is delegated to subcomponents of a collective group of individuals. These human collectives can be
thought of as organisms, which disintegrate under the weight of external selective pressures if not specialised for stability and expansion.
As humans, we are primed to want for social cohesion for the sake of our own survival, motivating the emergence of these communal structures,
which offer a wealth of cultural knowledge, economic opportunity in trade, and safety in numbers. These group identities scale from the 
local to the global, from a sense of self that relates to one's friends, family, colleagues, etc, to a sense of self that relates to one's 
nationality, ethnicity, social class, religion, etc.</p>
<p>Organisms evolve to embody a form that maximises the likelihood of their survival and proliferation, and will thus engage in predation,
parasitism and symbiosis. States evolve to embody a form that will maximise the likelihood of their stability and expansion, and will thus engage in both mutually
beneficial and conflict-based relations with foreign entities. We can define a state as a human collective that exists under a
singular system of governance. At all levels, entities with selectively advantageous traits will be promoted.
Social norms promote the authority of individuals with skills and charactersitics of perceived value. Monetary flow promotes the  
authority of businesses and organisations that provide the most value or create the most economic dependence.</p>
<p>In abstract terms, a state has a system of governance, governing a labor force, enforced by internal policing, to seek foreign 
opportunities, safe-guarded by military might. The degree of coupling between a state and its subcomponents becomes problematic
if too weak or too strong, devolving into tyranny, bureaucracy, military coups, widespread protest, etc. 
State military may exist as a combination of national forces, civilian militia and private contractors. 
Industry may be predominantly onshore or offshore, with the balance of net importation and exportation providing 
an economic profile of dependencies between states<sup>[9]</sup>. There will also exist some apparatus for the dissemination of information where the struggle for hearts and minds takes place. In the modern world, this occurs over news broadcast, social media, and the
internet. This information may be natural in the form of competing perspectives on current issues, or artificial in the form of
advertisement and propaganda.</p>
