<h3>Knowledge and Ideology</h3>
<p>Inquiring into the nature of knowledge is a tricky thing. Inquiry itself is founded upon knowledge, which as the subject of the inquiry,
is yet to be known. Knowledge must therefore initially be assumed, and from this assumption all else follows. The initial assumption can
be that "existence is perceived" or that "existence exists and is perceived". If existence doesn't exist or isn't perceived, everything that
exists does not exist, so nothing exists, and nothing else follows. If existence exists, all that exists exists, and all else follows. If
existence is perceived, all that is perceived exists, and all else follows. These two initial assumptions are ontological in that they
relate to the nature of being, but distinct in that only one affirms the existence of a reality external to the observer. This distinction
is between objectivism and subjectivism, the former asserting that reality exists external to the observer, subjectivism asserting that it
does not. Ontology inquires into the nature of being. Epistemology inquires into the nature of knowledge.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/research_methods.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>Empiricism, rationalism, and pragmatism are examples of epistemology, asserting that all that can be known is derived from the senses,
from reason, and from practical application of reason, respectively. We could class these epistemologies as belonging to a broader realist
epistemology, categorised by the belief that knowledge of an external reality can be obtained. Thus, a realist epistemology, rests on an 
objectivist ontology. This sits in contrast to an interpretivist epistemology, resting on a subjectivist ontology, which instead asserts
that knowledge can be known only in relation to the experience of the observer, not solely in the observation itself. From the notion of
epistemology, we can migrate to the notion of methods. If epistemology asserts the nature of what can be known, methods
assert how we can come to know it. Examples include deductive inference, inductive inference, experimental test, and case study.</p>
<p>Methods belong to a methodology, quantitative if it deals with numeric data, and qualitative otherwise. Although both methodologies deal
will the acquisition and integration of knowledge, the structure of the resulting knowledge base is likely to differ based on the methodology.
Let us conceptualise knowledge as a network of causal and correlative relations. The knowledge structure that emerges from inquiry into
the nature of propositional logic involves a finite and relatively small alphabet of logic symbols, a set of rules of inference, a set of
initial expressions, and a set of expressions discovered thorugh application of the rule set to the initial expressions. In the limit, this
knowledge structure has more depth than breadth. We can contrast this with the knowledge structure that emerges from inquiry into the 
nature of international relations, composed of a large base of historical case study and shallower but broader-reaching correlative patterns
identified across said knowledge base. In the limit of this case, there is more breadth than depth.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best known method of inquiry, the scientific method, can be applied to both quantitative and qualitative investigation. It is
empirical in nature, involving direct observation of a phenomenon, hypothesis as to the cause of the phenomenon, recreation of the
phenomenon in the sole presence of factors hypothesised to be causal or correlative (experimental test), analysis of the confirmed/refuted
hypothesis, and finally, drawing conclusions from the inquiry. This is an approach grounded in a realist epistemology and an objectivist 
ontology, as it assumes the existence of an external world that we can obtain knowledge about through the sense. The same method can be
appropriated for subjectivist ontologoies and non-realist epistemologies that believe knowledge to be obtained through analysis of
observation in the context of the observer. In such a case, the knowledge base derived from previous observation is not thought of as 
the accumulation of discovered objective knowledge, but as the knowledge base emergent of the set of inquiries made by researcher's 
operating with given methods and methodologies, within more abstract philosophical frameworks.</p>
<p>If we assume the existence of multiple observers, or assume the perception of the existence of multiple observers, and assume that
these multiple observers may make distinct observations, and inquire into some observations and not others, then we can begin to approach
the concept of ideology. The selective process can be thought of as an ideal, the observer possesses an ideal, motivating inquiry into
a subset of observations. If we are assuming that multiple observers exist, producing knowledge within their own ontological and 
epistemological viewpoints, then we can assume the establishment of disparate knowledge structures, and refer to their groupings as
ideologies. Ideologies may pertain to politics and the nature of governance, economics and the nature of wealth, philosophy and the nature
of nature, society and the nature of human behaviour, etc, or some hybridisation of the above.</p>
<p>We might then ask how the content of this specific document, in its inquiry into the nature of knowledge and ideology, sits within 
the nature of knowledge and ideology. Based on our assumptions and inferences thus far, it seems that this document is ontologically 
objectivist, epistemologically realist, and more rationalist than empiric or pragmatic. The document does not possess an ideology beyond
this, as we have not observed the observer writing the document, and have thus not placed the observer within an ideological category of
observation. The document's inquiry into the nature of knowledge seems to succesfully integrate knowledge of the nature of knowledge with
knowledge of the nature of inquiry. That being said, it seems that the obtained knowledge in such a rationalist endeavour decomposes
if the observer's perspective moves from the path we have just discussed (objectivism, realism, rationalism, etc) to a specific ideology.
If we move the lens of the observer to one of pure interpretivism, then the entire document decomposes into noise, as no analysis has been
made of the observer. Other ideologies are more compatible with the perspectives taken so far.</p>
<h3>Realism</h3>
<p>The rest of this document will explore a subset of ideologies of personal interest, looking to the assumptions they make and the 
heuristics they use. Let us start with Realism, a school of thought in international relations analysing the nature of governance at the
international level. Realism generally hold the following four principles as true:
<ul>State-centrism: international relations exists as the product of the interaction between states, defined as human collectives
under singular systems of governance.</ul>
<ul>Anarchy: no supranational authority exists, thus the system of state relations is anarchic in nature.</ul>
<ul>Rationality: states are rational actors, acting in accordance with a self-interest for survival and growth.</ul>
<ul>Power: the primary desire of a state is power for the purpose of self-preservation</ul>
<h4>The drawing and redrawing of historical lines</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective components of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. We as humans seek regions of 
abundance. Abundance gives us satiation in the short-term, through the availability of needed resources, and growth in the long-term,
by allowing energy to be expended on the discovery and development of new cultural and technological practices. The cradles of civilisation,
of which there are six, are the civilisations that emerged naturally from the developing practices of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. All
cradles of civilisation emerged in regions of abundance, and were characterised by agriculture, urban-dwellings, monument erection and use
of the written word. This includes Ancient Mesopotamia and the fertile crescent, Ancient Egypt and the Nile, Ancient India, the
Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra, Ancient China and the Yellow River, the Caral-Supe and the Fortaleza, the Pativilica and the Supe, and finally,
the Olmecs and the tropical lowlands of the gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>These river systems and coastal regions gave humans a reliable source of aquatic food, wildlife, and alluvial soil for agriculture. 
They also provided a means of transport, allowing humans to expand across a coast or river bank whilst maintaining a communal identity 
through frequent trade and travel. Other candidates for early civilisation may never have been realised due to a number of preventative
factors, including geographic isolation, harsh ecologies and temperamental climates (discouraging labor-intensive agricultural practice),
mountainous topographies (causing low population density that discourages urbanisation), and regions of frequent natural disaster.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/compounding_culture.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>Within these cradles of civilisation, cultural knowledge grew exponentially with respect to the number of generations for
which the knowledge was preserved, inherited and extended upon. The Sumerians of Ancient Mesopotamia developed the wheel, the sail, 
irrigation techniques, cuneiform literature, ziggurat temples, and social stratification (upper, middle, lower and enslaved). The Ancient
Egyptians, used pulleys, ramps and levers, developed papyrus paper, pottery
and rope trusses, and erected Abu Simbel, the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids. Despite the grandeur of these past cradles of civilisations, they, like all
others across human history, were subject to atrophy and strain in the form of war, plague, famine, and natural disaster.</p>
<p>The Three Kingdoms War of early China saw some 36 to 40 million people killed from conflict, famine and disease, approximately 20% of
the global population at the time<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>. The black death was estimated to have caused 75 to 200 million fatalities, and the plague of Justinian wiped
out 25%-60% of European inhabitants<sup>[4]</sup>. The Yellow River flood killed an estimated 2,000,000 people and the Bhola Cycle of East Pakistan/West
India an estimated 500,000 people<sup>[5]</sup></p>
<p>It is clear that human history has been shaped and punctuated by mass death and suffering across
nations and empires that form and stay bound through national, ethnic and religious identity. The fierceness of their competititon derives
from their military, industrial and political strength, making for a continual power struggle by which geographic lines are drawn and 
redrawn across history. With this, we arrive at our first heuristic: the natural world's geopolitical overlay, comprised of amoeboid like
nation-states<sup>[6][7]</sup> that rise and fall, spread and recede, fragment and combine.</p>
<h4>Structures of Governance</h4>
<p>A structure of governance, not unlike an organisational structure, is a structure that defines the way in which work and decision-making
is delegated to subcomponents of a collective group of individuals. These human collectives can be
thought of as organisms, which disintegrate under the weight of external selective pressures if not specialised for stability and expansion.
As humans, we are primed to want for social cohesion for the sake of our own survival, motivating the emergence of these communal structures,
which offer a wealth of cultural knowledge, economic opportunity in trade, and safety in numbers. These group identities scale from the 
local to the global, from a sense of self that relates to one's friends, family, colleagues, etc, to a sense of self that relates to one's 
nationality, ethnicity, social class, religion, etc.</p>
<p>Organisms evolve to embody a form that maximises the likelihood of their survival and proliferation, and will thus engage in predation,
parasitism and symbiosis. States evolve to embody a form that will maximise the likelihood of their stability and expansion, and will thus engage in both mutually
beneficial and conflict-based relations with foreign entities. We can define a state as a human collective that exists under a
singular system of governance. At all levels, entities with selectively advantageous traits will be promoted.
Social norms promote the authority of individuals with skills and charactersitics of perceived value. Monetary flow promotes the  
authority of businesses and organisations that provide the most value or create the most economic dependence.</p>
<p>In abstract terms, a state has a system of governance, governing a labor force, enforced by internal policing, to seek foreign 
opportunities, safe-guarded by military might. The degree of coupling between a state and its subcomponents becomes problematic
if too weak or too strong, devolving into tyranny, bureaucracy, military coups, widespread protest, etc. 
State military may exist as a combination of national forces, civilian militia and private contractors. 
Industry may be predominantly onshore or offshore, with the balance of net importation and exportation providing 
an economic profile of dependencies between states<sup>[8]</sup>. There will also exist some apparatus for the dissemination of information where the struggle for hearts and minds takes place. In the modern world, this occurs over news broadcast, social media, and the
internet. This information may be natural in the form of competing perspectives on current issues, or artificial in the form of
advertisement and propaganda.</p>
