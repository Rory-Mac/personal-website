<h4>Geopolitics</h4>
<p>Geopolitics is the study of the effect of Earth's geography (land, culture, and resources) over international relations (the interactions
between nations and their people). This blog post will attempt to compile some heuristics that can be used to view the world through a
geopolitical lens.</p>
<h4>The drawing and redrawing of historical lines</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective aspects of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. Of course, we as humans tend to cluster
around and seek influence over regions of abundance. Civilisations to emerge without the instigation of pre-existing civilisations, but
instead through a gradual process of cultural transition, are referred to as cradles of civilisation. Characteristic of cradles of
civilisation, as distinct from nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, include the written word, agricultural practice, urban-dwelling spaces
and monuments.</p>
<p>The catalyst for the advent of such a civilisation, at the very least, is a land abundant enough to allow for such.
There are six cradles of civilisation each of which are paired with a unique and abundant land, Mesopotamia (the fertile crescent),
Ancient Egypt (the Nile), Ancient India (the Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra), Ancient China (the Yellow River), the Caral-Supe of now 
modern Peru (the Fortaleza, the Pativilca, and the Supe), and the Olmec (tropical lowlands beside the gulf of mexico). Bountiful river
systems offered these ancient civilisations a source of food, land for agriculture, and a means of transport for both
people and material goods, enabling for the expansion of and simultaneous trade between peoples of the region.</p>
<p>But why in these six cradles of civilisation and not elsewhere? Civilisations may not have been able to spontaneously arise despite
a being mostly suitable due to a number of small but signficant preventative factors, such as a harsh ecology dissuading the advent 
of (initially) labor intensive farming, low population density preventing the urbanisation of people, and geographic isolation meaning
suitable sites just hadn't been explored. By the time these sites were explored, settlers came with their pre-existing culture and
agricultural practices, having stemmed through some number of civilisation steps and branches, from one of the six cradles of civilisation.</p>
<p>Developing language and technology and culture in these cradles of civilisation allowed for expansion without fragmentation, through
trade, exploration, and of course, conflict. Settlements promote trade, promotes exploration for goods to trade, promotes settlements in
new areas forging new cultural and ethnic identities, promotes more trade, as well as conflict. For conflict to arise, there has to be an
interest in conflict, whether it be economic in the acquisition of resources, or in the perceived threat of other nations and peoples 
against one's own. The cohesion needed to derive large collectives from individual communal entities is based in some sort of identity,
whether it be national, ethnic or religious. These perceptions of social cohesion can create evolving cultures that last thousands of years,
despite the turmoil of natural disaster and conflict.</p>
<p>In any case, we can imagine that the advent of civilisation occurred in mutiple pockets of abundance around the 
world, leading to technological development, incentivising broader trade and culture and exploration, leading to the establishment of 
nations across the world in fierce competition with one another, drawing and redrawing historical lines of influence through agreement
or force. As technology advances, the resources we compete for evolve in their sophistication, but the competition itself, as well as 
the conflict it begets, remains the same, whether it be wood, food, olive oil, gold, iron, steel, and slaves, in the ancient world, or 
crude oil fields and mineral reserves for silicon chip fabrication in the modern world. The foundation for war is economics. If a nation
has the reserves, the manufacturing capacity, the industrial output, the will of its people and the opportunity for gain through military
action, in all likelihood, it will seek to provoke war.</p>
<p>Historical lines are shaped both by conflict and natural disaster. The three kingdoms war saw 70% of ancient China decimated, World War
II saw some 70 million people killed, through combat, famine, and disease, the prospect of nuclear war threatens global deaths summing to
a 63% reduction in global population. Ancient floods reshaped entire regions, the plague of Justinian resulting in a population reduction
of 50%, as did the bubonic plague. Across history nations are rising and falling, expanding,
fragmenting and conjoing with our nations to form empires.</p>
<p>Thus we can conceptualise a geopolitical overlay onto the world map as a set of amoeboid like nation-states, with movements motivated
by economic and human forces. The next heuristic to explore is one that encompasses the driving forces of allowing for social cohesion
within these individual nations. What enables collectives comprised of millions of people to form, despite individual familiarity with
only a small cohort of social peers.</p>
<h4>Organisational Structures</h4>
<p>An organisational structure is a structure defining how individuals operate within a collective. What specialised subcomponents (that is,
subgroups of individuals working serving a unique function to the broader collection) are needed to ensure that the collective is 
self-sustaining with a higher chance of survival against the many other collectives to exist? A labor force, agricultural, industrial 
and technological, drives the progression of the technological sophistication of the state and creates the common goods needed to sustain 
the people that belong to it. A cultural identity assist this work ethic, which is why wartime motivates the consolidation of core cultural
beliefs. A governing component is also necessary to concretise the laws by which the state is governed, setup in hierarchical fashion to 
regulate aspects of industry at all levels. Of course, law is meeaningless without enforcement, and so an internal policing force and 
external military is used to enforce such. There may be levels of cohesion between the citizens a military protects and the military iteslf,
subdivided into the official national armed forces, private military contractors and militia.</p>
<p>The agency problem arises when low cohesion between a subcomponent and the collective or subcomponents within the collective threatens
the growth and stability of that collective. In less abstract terms, such may look like widespread protests, autocracy or a military coup.
Another blight on the collective is stagnation and the effect of bureaucracy, where the passing of legislature is upheld by state officials
as opposed to elected representatives, leading to a pernicious drift between the interests of state and individual. The ensuing 
administerial incompetence can be quite absurd, as was the case of a seal with headphones.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will exist some apparatus for the dissemination of information, which in the modern world consists of news broadcast,
social media and the internet. It is in this subset of the collective that the struggle for hearts and minds occurs, with competing 
narratives vying to instill a given perception of the world in its receivers. This may be artificial in the form of advertisement and 
propaganda, or natural in the form of competing viewpoints on current issues.</p>
<p>The next step is to analyse the structure of the narratives themselves as the propagate through and across united collectives. This 
is explored in a separate blog post on narrative maps.</p>
