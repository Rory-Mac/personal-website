<h4>Geopolitics</h4>
<p>Geopolitics is the study of the effect Earth's geography has over international relations, and how land, resources and human behaviour
effect the establishment of and interaction between nations and their people. This post will attempt to compile heuristics that help us 
see the world through a geopolitical lens.</p>
<h4>The drawing and redrawing of historical lines</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective components of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. We as humans seek regions of 
abundance. Abundance gives us satiation in the short-term, through the availability of needed resources, and growth in the long-term,
by allowing energy to be expended on the discovery and development of new cultural and technological practices. The cradles of civilisation,
of which there are six, are the civilisations that emerged naturally from the developing practices of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. All
cradles of civilisation emerged in regions of abundance, and were characterised by agriculture, urban-dwellings, monument erection and use
of the written word. This includes Ancient Mesopotamia and the fertile crescent, Ancient Egypt and the Nile, Ancient India, the
Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra, Ancient China and the Yellow River, the Caral-Supe and the Fortaleza, the Pativilica and the Supe, and finally,
the Olmecs and the tropical lowlands of the gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>These river systems and coastal regions gave humans a reliable source of aquatic food, wildlife, and alluvial soil for agriculture. 
They also provided a means of transport, allowing humans to expand across a coast or river bank whilst maintaining a communal identity 
through frequent trade and travel. Other candidates for early civilisation may never have been realised due to a number of preventative
factors, including geographic isolation, harsh ecologies and temperamental climates (discouraging labor-intensive agricultural practice),
mountainous topographies (causing low population density that discourages urbanisation), and regions of frequent natural disaster.</p>

<p>Within these cradles of civilisation, cultural knowledge grew exponentially with respect to the number of generations for
which the knowledge was preserved, inherited and extended upon. The Sumerians of Ancient Mesopotamia developed the wheel, the sail, 
irrigation techniques, cuneiform literature, ziggurat temples, and social stratification (upper, middle, lower and enslaved). The Ancient
Egyptians, used pulleys, ramps and levers, developed papyrus paper, pottery
and rope trusses, and erected Abu Simbel, the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids. Despite the grandeur of these past cradles of civilisations, they, like all
others across human history, were subject to atrophy and strain in the form of war, plague, famine, and natural disaster.</p>
<p>The Three Kingdoms War of early China saw some 36 to 40 million people killed from conflict, famine and disease, approximately 20% of
the global population at the time<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>. The black death was estimated to have caused 75 to 200 million fatalities, and the plague of Justinian wiped
out 25%-60% of European inhabitants<sup>[4]</sup>. The Yellow River flood killed an estimated 2,000,000 people and the Bhola Cycle of East Pakistan/West
India an estimated 500,000 people<sup>[5]</sup></p>
<p>It is clear that human history has been shaped and punctuated by mass death and suffering across
nations and empires that form and stay bound through national, ethnic and religious identity. The fierceness of their competititon derives
from their military, industrial and political strength, making for a continual power struggle by which geographic lines are drawn and 
redrawn across history. With this, we arrive at our first heuristic: the natural world's geopolitical overlay, comprised of amoeboid like
nation-states<sup>[6][7]</sup> that rise and fall, spread and recede, fragment and combine.</p>
<h4>Structures of Governance</h4>
<p>A structure of governance, not unlike an organisational structure, is a structure that defines the way in which work and decision-making
is delegated to subcomponents of a collective group of individuals. These human collectives can be
thought of as organisms, which disintegrate under the weight of external selective pressures if not specialised for stability and expansion.
As humans, we are primed to want for social cohesion for the sake of our own survival, motivating the emergence of these communal structures,
which offer a wealth of cultural knowledge, economic opportunity in trade, and safety in numbers. These group identities scale from the 
local to the global, from a sense of self that relates to one's friends, family, colleagues, etc, to a sense of self that relates to one's 
nationality, ethnicity, social class, religion, etc.</p>
<p>Organisms evolve to embody a form that maximises the likelihood of their survival and proliferation, and will thus engage in predation,
parasitism and symbiosis. States evolve to embody a form that will maximise the likelihood of their stability and expansion, and will thus engage in both mutually
beneficial and conflict-based relations with foreign entities. We can define a state as a human collective that exists under a
singular system of governance. At all levels, entities with selectively advantageous traits will be promoted.
Social norms promote the authority of individuals with skills and charactersitics of perceived value. Monetary flow promotes the  
authority of businesses and organisations that provide the most value or create the most economic dependence.</p>
<p>In abstract terms, a state has a system of governance, governing a labor force, enforced by internal policing, to seek foreign 
opportunities, safe-guarded by military might. The degree of coupling between a state and its subcomponents becomes problematic
if too weak or too strong, devolving into tyranny, bureaucracy, military coups, widespread protest, etc. 
State military may exist as a combination of national forces, civilian militia and private contractors. 
Industry may be predominantly onshore or offshore, with the balance of net importation and exportation providing 
an economic profile of dependencies between states<sup>[8]</sup>. There will also exist some apparatus for the dissemination of information where the struggle for hearts and minds takes place. In the modern world, this occurs over news broadcast, social media, and the
internet. This information may be natural in the form of competing perspectives on current issues, or artificial in the form of
advertisement and propaganda.
</p>
<p>Analysis of the narratives themselves as they propagate across a collective is quite interesting, explored in a separate post
on narrative maps.</p>
