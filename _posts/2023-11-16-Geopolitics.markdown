<h4>Geopolitics</h4>
<p>Geopolitics is the study of the effect of Earth's geography (land, culture, and resources) over international relations (the interactions
between nations and their people). This blog post will attempt to compile some heuristics that can be used to view the world through a
geopolitical lens.</p>
<h4>The drawing and redrawing of historical lines</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective aspects of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. Of course, we as humans tend to cluster
around and seek influence over regions of abundance. Civilisations to emerge without the instigation of pre-existing civilisations, but
instead through a gradual process of cultural transition, are referred to as cradles of civilisation. Characteristic of cradles of
civilisation, as distinct from nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, include the written word, agricultural practice, urban-dwelling spaces
and monuments. The catalyst for the advent of such a civilisation, at the very least, is a land abundant enough to allow for such.
There are six cradles of civilisation each of which are paired with a unique and abundant land, Mesopotamia (the fertile crescent),
Ancient Egypt (the Nile), Ancient India (the Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra), Ancient China (the Yellow River), the Caral-Supe of now 
modern Peru (the Fortaleza, the Pativilca, and the Supe), and the Olmec (tropical lowlands beside the gulf of mexico).</p>

    where are the inhabitants clustered? what resources do we humans need and fight over?
        why don't civilisations emerge elsewhere
        flash points of today and their resources, ukraine, taiwan, israel
    where are the blocks
    how has this changed from history
    why has it changed so much?
        war in china reduced population by 70%, plague of justinian reduced by 50%, nuclear war could reduce by approximately 63%
        large empires splitting apart
        nations grouping together
    why is there constaint? China, Egypt, Israel/Palestine
        bonded by race, ethnicity, nationality, religion
    creates amoeboid nation-states continually spreading, withdrawing, splitting and grouping

    new heuristic: what is going on within a single nation-state?
        organisational structures and subcomponents
        what maintains and breaks cohesion (4-star of hatred)
        new incentives, economic, military, diplomatic, the agency problem
        struggle for hearts and minds, hypocrisy, peloponnesian war, state over individual, individual over state
    new heuristic: narrative forces and perspectives of the world
        incorporate narrative structure document
        what is driving the narrative forces between individuals
        how does it cascade up to the global and down to the individual?
