<h4>Geopolitics</h4>
<!-- 
    amoeboid-like spread, historical lines being drawn and redrawn again and again
    not entirely haphazard, constrained by religious belief and ethnicity 
    organisational structures, subcomponents, cohesion
    new incentives, economic, military, diplomatic, and the agency problem
    struggle for hearts and minds, hypocrisy, peloponnesian war, state over individual, individual over state
