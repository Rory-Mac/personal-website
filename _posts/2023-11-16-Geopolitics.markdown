<h4>Geopolitics</h4>
<p>Geopolitics is the study of the effect Earth's geography has over international relations, and how land, resources and human behaviour
effect the establishment of and interaction between nations and their people. This post will attempt to compile heuristics that help us 
see the world through a geopolitical lens.</p>
<h4>The drawing and redrawing of historical lines</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective components of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. We as humans seek regions of 
abundance. Abundance gives us satiation in the short-term, through the availability of needed resources, and growth in the long-term,
by allowing energy to be expended on the discovery and development of new cultural and technological practices. The cradles of civilisation,
of which there are six, are the civilisations that emerged naturally from the developing practices of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. All
cradles of civilisation emerged in regions of abundance, and were characterised by agriculture, urban-dwellings, monument erection and use
of the written word. This includes Ancient Mesopotamia and the fertile crescent, Ancient Egypt and the Nile, Ancient India, the
Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra, Ancient China and the Yellow River, the Caral-Supe and the Fortaleza, the Pativilica and the Supe, and finally,
the Olmecs and the tropical lowlands of the gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>These river systems and coastal regions gave humans a reliable source of aquatic food, wildlife, and alluvial soil for agriculture. 
They also provided a means of transport, allowing humans to expand across a coast or river bank whilst maintaining a communal identity 
through frequent trade and travel. Other candidates for early civilisation may never have been realised due to a number of preventative
factors, including geographic isolation, harsh ecologies and temperamental climates (discouraging labor-intensive agricultural practice),
mountainous topographies (causing low population density that discourages urbanisation), and regions of frequent natural disaster.
Cultural knowledge has a compounding effect, growing exponentially with respect to the number of generations passed for which this 
knowledge has been preserved, inherited and extended upon.</p>

<p>The Sumerians of Ancient Mesopotamia developed the wheel, the sail, irrigation techniques, cuneiform literature, ziggurat temples, social
stratification (upper, middle, lower and enslaved). The Ancient Egyptians, used pulleys, ramps and levers, developed papyrus paper, pottery
and rope truasses, and constructed the Sphinx and the great pyramids. We have looked at the factors contributing to the rise of these great
civilisations, but not factors contributing to their fall.</p>
<p>The greatest historical threats to a civilisation appear to be conflict, famine, plague and natural disaster. The three kingdoms war
and consequent mass famine and infectious disease, saw some 36,000,000 to 40,000,000 million people killed, approximately 20% of the 
global population. The black death was estimated to have caused 75,000,000 to 200,000,000 fatalaties, and the plague of Justinian wiped
out 25%-60% of European inhabitants. The Yellow River flood killed an estimated 2,000,000 people and the Bhola Cycle of East Pakistan/West
India an estimated 500,000 people. The civilisations we have looked at form and remain bound by national, ethnic and religious identities.
Thus we can conceptualise the world map as having a geopolitical overlay comprised of amoeboid like nation-states, which rise and fall,
spread and recede, fragment and combine, continuously drawing and redrawing historical lines in accordance with the military, industrial
and political strength of nations across history.</p>
<h4>Structures of Governance</h4>
<p>A structure of governance, not unlike an organisational structure, is a structure that underlies a collective group of individuals,
defining how responsibilities are delegated to subgroups within that collective, and how information flows therein. Selective pressures
apply to these collectives, which disintegrate if not specialised for stability and expansion. We as humans are primed to want for social
cohesion, for the strength of relationships between ourselves and our community and between members within our community, for the purpose
of survival. The emergence of communal organisms stems from this fact. Individuals act and at times sacrifice for the benefit of the 
collective, and in turn they receive the wealth of collective cultural knowledge and reaps the safety benefits of a cohese collective.
National, ethnic and cultural identities may comprise groups in the order of millions if not billions. How can this be if humans are limited 
to interaction with a closer community not in excess of 150 individuals? Group identities stack in hierarchical fashion from the local to
the global. Individuals exist within family units, friend groups, with colleagues, with hobbyist circles, etc. These social pockets stack 
to form the global environment, lowering the resolution of group dynamics to that of race, ethnicity, nationality, and religion.</p>
<p>We can refer to a group of individuals under a singular system of governance as a state, subdivided into the components necessary for
survival and expansion, just as organisms engage in symbiotic relationships for the purpose of survival and proliferation. At all levels,
there is a process by which entities with selectively advantageous traits are promoted. Social norms promote at all levels the authority of
individuals who have skills and charactersitics perceived to be of value. Groups, businesses, organisations, movemements, etc. behave the
same way, with increased trade and monetary flow to entities that are needed and are of value. This discussion is painting an idealic
picture of the nature of symbiotic relationships between group entities. Parasitism and conflict also exist as additional internal pressures
to a state apparatus. Examples include looting and rioting, militiary coups, autocracy and widespread protest. Bureaucracy is another 
blight that lead to the internal decay of a state entity, where the passing of legislature is upheld by state officials
as opposed to elected representatives, leading to a pernicious drift between the interests of state and individual. The ensuing 
administerial incompetence can be quite absurd, as in the case of a seal with headphones.</p>
<p>Necessary aspects of a sufficiently large collective bound by a cultural identity include a labor force, a system of governance, a
military and internal policing force. The labor force progresses the technological sophistication of the state and manufacture the goods
needed to sustain the people that belong to it. A system of governance constructs law, regulates industry and creates policy to concretize 
the broader mission statement of the state (economic strategy, budgeting, foreign policy, etc). Military, combined with intelligence
agencies, spy networks etc, as well as diplomatic envoys and ambassadors, deal with foreign interests both conducive and non-conducive to 
the interests of the state. An internal policing force enforces law, which is of course meaningless if not enforced. These aspects of the 
state might be central to the state itself, or more symbiotic ane external in nature. For instance a country's military may consist of an 
official national defense as well as private military contractors and civilian militia. Industry is similarly tightly bound to foreign 
economies, with the balance between net importation and exportation acting as an economic profile to show dependencies between states.</p>
<p>Additionally, there will inevitably exist some apparatus for the dissemination of information within a state, which in the modern world
consists of news broadcast, social media and the internet. It is in this subset of the collective that the struggle for hearts and minds 
occurs, where competing narratives vie to instill a suitable perception of the world in its receivers. This may be natural if in the form
of competition between differing viewpoints on current issues, or artificial if in the form of advertisement and propaganda.</p>
<p>We can go on to analyse the structure of the narratives themselves as they propagate through and across united collectives. This 
is explored in a separate blog post on narrative maps.</p>
