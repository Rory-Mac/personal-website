            <h3>Multi-layer Neural Networks</h3>
            <p>So far we have looked at the structural and mathematical foundations of neural networks alongside supervised learning in single-layer models. 
            In this document we will look at reinforcement learning in multi-layer models alongside the underlying theory of such (cost functions and backpropagation).</p>
            <p>Unlike in supervised learning, in reinforcement learning, the most desirable output for a given input is not given as a reference to the model. Instead, 
            a cost or reward value is given to the model, which itself is proportional to how close the output produced was to the maximally desired output:
                \[ E = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (z_i - t_i)^2 \]
            In this equation \(i\) is the identifier of one of \(n\) output nodes denoted as \(z_i\). Then, \(t_i\) is one of \(n\) comparison nodes that exist in 
            a one-to-one pairing with the output. The difference between the actual output and target output is then squared to weight large differences more heavily
            than small differences. By thinking of \(E\) as a height, we essentially create a cost landscape over our output space, which is most easily visualised
            in two dimensions:
