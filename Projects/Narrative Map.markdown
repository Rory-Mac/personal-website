<h4>Narrative Map</h4>
<p>Narrative Map is a project that emerged from the attempt to identify patterns in human narrative. Profound narratives are powerful in their ability to shape our
perception of the world around us, the actions we take therein, and the actions we hope to take thereafter. Patterns in narratives might speak to an underlying 
structure from which profound narratives emerge. The thought of such a structure excites me very much. As with all technical projects, I think the inspiration is 
important to keep close in mind. It begets all else in the project, not the other way around.</p>
<p>A narrative is a set of micro-narratives in succession, for instance, "this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened, and so on". A micro-narrative 
is a transition between perceived environments, for instance, "this happened, and then this happened". We could use definitions that appear identical for human experience.
Human experience is a set of micro-experiences in succession, "this was perceived, and then this was perceived, and then this was perceived, and so on". The relationship
between human narrative and human experience appears to be that human narrative is the compression of human experience. I like to think about this visually:</p>

<p>We have an agent that perceives. The agent perceives a stream of experiences attributed with pleasure and pain, which rise and fall in a continuously differentiable
fasion. This perception is compressed (as an analog signal might to a digital signal) and stored in memory, reflecting that "this was perceived, and then this was perceived,
and then this was perceived, and so on". Memory sorts experience based on perceptual similarities to form templates. The stream of experience the agent perceives is 
predictable if the features identified within it match that of previously experienced perceptual transitions (the experience reinforces the memory structure) and 
unpredictable otherwise (experiences damages or builds upon the memory structure). Narratives (compressions of experience) are then exchanged between agents:

<p>If narratives are compressions of experience and experiences are sequences of perceptual transitions between predictable and unpredictable pleasure and pain, then we
would expect all narratives to be reducable to a finite set of templates that correspond to each such perceptual transition. As the stream of experience continues,
templates form from recurring features of experience that build upon these fundamental templates, creating a tree like structure within each agent. The height of the
template in the tree corresponds to its compression ratio for the lived experience it follows from. Before attempting to identify the structure of the tree itself,
let us first identify the foundational templates. The first perceptual template emerges the moment an agent perceives its environment: predictability 
(known), unpredictability (unknown) and the set of transitions between the two.</p>
