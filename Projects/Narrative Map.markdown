<h3>Narrative Map</h3>
<p>A micro-narrative is two perceived environments in succession. A narrative is a set of micro-narratives in succession. To put it less formally, 
a micro-narrative is "this happened and then this happened" and a narrative is "this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened, and so on".
Experience is no different, "this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened, and so on". Narratives compress experience. If 
"this happened, and then this happened, and then this happened, and so on" is experienced, then only a subset is communicated in the form of narrative.
The narrative filters for information based on the weight of the information (the degree to which it is desirable or undesirable). The narrative
compresses the strongly weighted-information by merging it with strongly weighted-information in memory of similiarly defining characteristics. I visualise 
the filtering aspect of narratives with the following heuristics:

A vertical slot represents the information state of a perceiving agent. 
The white-black gradient corresponds to the weight of the information state (sign-independent) which transforms into a green-black gradient 
(low-cost/high-reward) and a red-black gradient (high-cost/low-reward) when the information is signed as positive/negative. Narrative compression can then 
be visualised like so:

I would recommend opening the image in a new tab for greater resolution. Each circle represents a perceving agent. The agent perceives a continual 
transformation between desirable and undesirable information states. These states are compressed into templates of desirability (green), undesirability (red),
undesirable-to-desirable transformations (red-green) and desirable-undesirable transformations (green-red). Agents communicate compressions of individual 
experience, creating another experiential channel from which compressions (and thus templates of experience) emerge. The compression ratio of the narrative, 
(its elevation in the pyrmaid of compressions), corresponds to the the degree to which the narrative is selectively advantageous. This is true within the
individual, the collective, and the collective of collectives that exist across time.</p>
<p>Thus the longest-surviving narratives have the highest compression ratio, i.e. they represent the most fundamental aspects of human experience. The
longest-surviving narratives are micro-narratives by definition, as they have higher compression ratios than larger narratives. However, these 
longest-surviving micro-narratives are embedded within myriad larger narratives that are themselves broadly disseminated in a given time period and
culture. To concretize an experiential-narrative mapping we can either take a bottom-up approach by identifying narrative elements that recur across time 
and culture and linking said elements to universal experiences, or we can take a top-down approach by identifying universal experiences and linking them
to narrative elements that recur across time and culture.
<p>We make a set of assumptions as to what experiences are universal:
    <ul>
        <li>All humans experience consciousness and non-consciousness (by being awake and asleep, drowsy and alert, perceiving life and death, etc).</li>
        <li>All humans experience desirability and undesirability (by experiencing environments associated with pleasure and pain).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a sense of self (of that which predictably moves with perception from environment to environment).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a sense of other (of that which is not self but acts to attain that which is desired just as self does).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a relationship between self and mother (whether present or absent, loving or hateful, guiding or controlling).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a relationship between self and father (whether present or absent, loving or hateful, guiding or controlling).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a relationship between self and child (in early experiences as the self that interfaces with mother and father and other, 
            in later experience as the self that interfaces with the earlier child-like self begotten of early experience).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a relationship between self and man (what masculinity is perceived as being, both externally and in relation to self).</li>
        <li>All humans experience a relationship between self and woman (what femininity is perceived as being, both externally and in relation to self).</li> 
    </ul>

We then identify narrative elements that recur across time and culture, and determine how these elements relate to universal experience. If we find 
a contradiction, that is a narrative that recurs across time and culture but does not fit into our graph, it likely means that the above set of assumptions 
is wrong or incomplete. It is an iterative process still in progress:
