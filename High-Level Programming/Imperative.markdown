<h4>Imperative Programming</h4>
<p>Imperative programming is a programming paradigm in which the sequence of steps that require execution by the computer map to the 
sequence of steps we are explicity writing in code. When writing in an imperative language, we are essentially constructing algorithms.
An algorithm is a finite set of rigorous instructions that transforms a set of inputs into a set of outputs. We seek to design algorithms
that implement our desired input-output pairings with minimum run-time cost and minimum memory usage. It is typically the first paradigm 
learnt by a programmer, who upon becoming rehearsed in the features of a given imperative language, begins moving towards implementation 
of abstract data types and definition of their interfaces. An abstract data type is constructed from a combination of primitive data 
types and access functions. Primitive data types include integers, characters, booleans, and arrays. Abstract data types include linked
lists, dictionaries, trees, stacks, heaps, queues, graphs, and so on.</p> 
<h5>Arrays</h5>
<p> An array is a primitive data type with a linear ordering (by index). Arrays can be uni-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Arrays can be of fixed or 
dynamic size. It can be helpful to color-code subsets of an array, and visualise numerical values as heights in a histogram.</p>

<h5>Linked Lists</h5>
<p>A linked list is a data structure containing a linear set of data elements. Unlike an array, the ordering of data elements in a linked
list does not necessarily correspond to their ordering in physical memory. Linked lists can be singly or doubly linked.</p>
