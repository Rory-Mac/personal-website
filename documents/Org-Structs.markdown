<h4>Organisational Structure</h4>
<p>A project begins with the abstract ideation of a system that would fulfill some desirable function, and ends in the limit of iterative
design, where this desired function has been realised. The iterative design of a system across time is a product of the work of a
collective of individuals. This collective exists as a component of the system itself: the mechanism by which iteration through design
instances occurs towards an ideal form. Organisational structure describes the structure of this collective, and how collective action
emerges from the properties of these individuals and their interoperation.</p>

<p>Take a normal distribution over \(n\) axes where each axis encodes a property predicting the strategy profiles to underlie individual
action. This heuristic helps to reduce the complexity of the individual to that which is of relevance to an organised collective. An 
approximation of the individual attributes most fundamental to the cohesion of an organisational structure is as follows: conscientousness,
fluid intelligence, openness, and communicativeness. Conscientousness equates to work output, fluid intelligence to the quality of the 
work, openness and communicativeness to the degree to which the work exists as the unified hypothesis of the organisation, rather than as
a disparate set of individual hypotheses.</p>
<p>Organisational structures are paired with power-law abiding incentive structures. Inflow of individuals into the structure pass a
selective membrane based on the criteria set forth by the organisation. Additional incentives then determine the retention rate of 
individuals within the organisation, and the ratio of inflow to outflow. The action of incentives can be visualised as bubble-up and 
bubble-down operations in a hierarchical tree. Stock, stock options, salary, executive decision-making, etc., are all examples of
incentives rewarding actions desired for by the culture of the organisation. In the ideal scenario, the incentives align the individual 
to the collective to the syste itself as it undergoes iterative design.  </p>
