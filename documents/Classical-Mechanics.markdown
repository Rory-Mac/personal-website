<h4>Classical Mechanics</h4>
<p>We start with the kinematic equations of motion, derived from definitions of displacement, velocity and acceleration.
\[ a = \frac{v-u}{t}, \>\>\>\> \frac{s}{t} = \frac{v + u}{2} \]
\[ v = u + at \]
\[ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]
\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \]
\[ s = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2 \]
We can derive equivalent kinematic equations of rotational motion by defining angular velocity \(Ï‰ = \frac{v}{r}\).
\[ \propto = \frac{\omega_1-\omega_0}{t}, \>\>\>\> \frac{\theta}{t} = \frac{\omega_1 + \omega_0}{2} \]
We introduce mass conceptually as resistance to motion, and define its relation to force and momentum.
Moment of inertia exists as the rotational analog to mass for which equivalent equations can be defined.
\[ F = ma, \>\>\>\> p = mv, \>\>\>\> F = \frac{p}{t} \]
Next, we take work conceptually as the conversion of force to displacement, power as work over time, and kinetic energy as the integral 
of momentum with respect to velocity.  
\[ W = Fs, \>\>\>\> P = \frac{W}{t}, \>\>\>\> KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2, \>\>\>\> W = \Delta KE \]</p>
<p>All above foundational equations can be derived for both the discrete and continuous case.</p>
