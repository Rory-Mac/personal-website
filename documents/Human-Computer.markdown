<h4>Human-Computer Interaction</h4>
<p>Interaction with digital technology can be thought of as biological IO interfacing with virtual rather than physical worlds. 
The individual interfaces with digital technology may take the role of a user, a developer or an explorer. A user users the 
applications available to them, a developer develops applications to be used, and an explorer explores the infrastructure itself.
An individual's role is not static. For instance, a developer may be developing a new application having explored some new aspect
of digital technology after dissatisfied by their experience as a user with a pre-existing set of software applications.</p>

<p>As discussed in earlier blog posts, the degree to which the digital components of this interface satiates the desire of the biological
components acts as the selective pressure determining the survival and proliferation of said digital components. The digital components
to survive and proliferate within this evolutionary process are the ones that facilitate the creation of desirable virtual landscapes,
or assist in increasing the bandwidth and decreasing the latency associated with our access to said desirable virtual landscapes. 
These landscapes themselves are also abstractions running on digital components and belong to the same evolutionary process.
As developers, we can keep in mind that for a given objective, what we are ultimately trying to do is create an application that interfaces
with minimal latency and maximal bandwidth to the components that benefit from its existence.</p>
<p>To create a deeper intuition into the interaction not between terminal and user but terminal and terminal, and the workings of the
modern-day internet, we can compile visual heuristics.</p>

<p>These heuristics give a sense of the internet as a collective nervous system rather than a rigid telecommunications network. The
development, integration and evolution of complex neural networks into this nervous system will have profound implications. With 
higher bandwidth, lower latency digital-to-biological neural network interfaces (potentially culminating in the mass adoption of
commercial BMIs), the relationship between humanity and technology is likely to grow evermore intimate in the coming decades,
perhaps even more so than the advent of the internet and with it the modern digital age.</p>
