<h4>Project Evolution</h4>
<p>A project begins with the abstract conception of a system that would fulfill some desirable function. The plausibility of the
existence of the system is then considered. Its requirements are articulated, and an understanding of the physical and mathematical 
constraints that would limit its evolution, is sort after. Here it is useful to think in the limit. Imagine that an infinite 
supply of resources and engineering talent is targeted towards the realisation of this system, and introduce more realistic constraints 
from there.</p>

<p>The next step is to be biased towards deletion. Deletion is an inevitability. We cannot wait to be perfectly confident in our design 
decisions before making them, which means some design decisions will prove wrong and some developed system components will prove useless
later on. One approach is to develop components for all conceivable cases, and identify the most necessary ones after the fact. The other
is to hypothesise which components are necessary, and to create and delete components with respect to that hypothesis. As risk-averse 
creatures, we are inclined to favor the former, because re-adding a deleted system component seems far greater a cost than having a 
system component that is of no use. The problem is that if components only exist 'in-case' they serve some present or future function, 
then there is no real hypothesis, just a brute-force approach. If we instead bias towards deletion, then the system evolves with our proven
and disproven hypotheses, converging to the goal system at a much faster rate.</p>

<p>The third step is to optimise. It is pointless to optimise a system component that will soon prove irrelevant to the overall
design. This is why we want to have developed confidence in the necessity of our system components through iterations of hypotheses as
previously discussed. Only then can we begin to optimise the system components that really matter. Optimisation introduces a new level
of abstraction, and so it is important that it apply only to the core components of our evolving design, the 
components that have been most impervious to design changes for the most amount of time.</p>

<p>Finally, we look to automation. Initially we conceive of the work-producing system component that drives partial fulfillment of its
desired function, and iteration towards total fulfillment of its desired function, as the engineer. Optimisation of this system component 
is akin to automation is akin to minimisation of the work required to realise the final design of the desired system.</p>
