<h4>Memory</h4>
<p>We can view memory as structure built atop a river of experience. Experience is perceived, filtered and manipulated in some way,
before being stored in memory. Memory can be thought to exist as a hierarchy of subdivisions, the first being the subdivision of memory
into sensory memory, short-term/working memory, and long-term memory. This takes a functional view of memory, with each functional unit having a biological basis:
a set of regions within the brain that interact with one another to implement a given function. This bears resemblance to digital 
recurrent neural networks, networks where the neural input is in some way the product of the neural output.</p>

<p>Sensory Memory is memory that briefly retains immediate sensory signals, and can be subdivided into types of sensory memory for each 
sense, including iconic (vision), echoic (audition) haptic (touch), gustation (taste) and olfaction (smell). The matrices used in
Sperling's experimental design help to distinguish between iconic memory and short-term memory, by demonstrating
that an observer has greater accuracy in recalling rows of a flashed character matrix than the matrix in its entirety, even though
the row signal occurs after the matrix dissapears. This effect diminishes as the row signal is delayed, suggesting that short-term memory
is distinct from an immediate sensory memory that it filters. Later research suggested that working memory uses a phonological loop 
to compress iconic memory into phonological signals. Thus, it seems that although sensory memory may be pre-categorical in nature, working memory is not
<sup>[2]</sup>.
<p>The Cognitive Reflection test<sup>[3]</sup> can be helpful in intuitively understanding the distinction between short-term/working memory 
and long-term memory. This test has simple intuitive answers that can be arrived at quickly via their retrieval from long-term memory. These 
answers are wrong however. The actual solutions are arrived at in a less intuitive and more time-consuming manner with the help of working 
memory. Short-term memory has a channel-like capacity, with recall of sequential bits of information averaging nine in experimental tests,
five in the case of monosyllabic english words, and seven in the case of english letters<sup>[4]</sup>. This capacity exists with
respect to the number of units, not the information contained within said units, thus working memory can use chunking to increase the 
effective recall of a set of items, if patterns within said items allow them to be chunked together.</p>
<p>If short-term memory maps to fluid intelligence, long-term memory maps to crystallised intelligence, storing the conclusions arrived
at by the manipulation that occurs within working memory. Long-term memory can be subdivided into explicit and implicit memory, that is
memory that can be retreived consciously and unconsciously. Explicit memory that can be consciously recalled includes episodic memory 
(memory of events) and semantic memory (memory of conceptual facts). Answering the question "what books have you read?" is much more 
difficult than answering a sequence of questions of the form "have you read ____?". Intuitively, this suggests that retrieval of episodic
and semantic memory is optimised for retrieval to working memory in relation to a stimulus, rather than traversal within the explicit 
memory itself.</p>
<p>Implicit memory that is recalled unconsciously, is subdivided into procedural, associative, non-associative memory and
priming. Procedural memory stores the motor skills required for the execution of physical tasks. Associative memory relates to memory
that upon retrieval triggers the retrieval of information learnt to be associated with it. This learning can be divided into 
classical and operant conditioning. Non-associative memory relates to memory that upon retrieval is amplified or dampened as a result
of the neurological processes of habituation and sensitisation. Primary then refers to the phenomenon of long-term memory retrieval 
being biased by the contents of working memory. As a simple example, a subject is more likely to fill in the blank of "SO__" with "SOAP"
if they were recently presented with words of similiar meaning or close affiliation, even after those words had long dissipated from 
conscious recall<sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
<p>We can return to our initial heuristic of memory as structure built atop an experiential river, and consider the best ways to facilitate
the evolution of such a structure. The ideal structure would look like one with a considerable degree of breadth and depth. This is not 
so easily achieved, given the complexity of the environment's we encounter and the brain's tendency to filter, forget and compress. 
Memory techniques can be used to help increase the experiential throughput actually contributing to the evolution of our memory structures.
This includes physiological health, sleep, diet and exercise, as well as more esoteric methods like active recall, the journey method, and
associative learning through soundness and absurdity.</p>
