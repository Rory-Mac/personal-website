<h4>Working Memory</h4>
<p>A subset of gradient imprint from sensory memory is processed in what we term working memory. The capacity of working memory is
shared amongst the spatial and temporal components of the information it works upon. If in the absence of chunking the limit of recall of a
newly encountered spatial and temporal sequence is four, it is not the case that one can recall four sequential spatial group of four across
time.</p>

<p>Perceptual sequences in space and time are equivalent with respect to information processing in memory, i.e. a perceptual sequence
through a group of elements in space is akin to a perceptual sequence through a group of transformations in time. Composition of simple
sequences generates complex sequences, decomposition of complex sequences generates simple sequences.

<p>From this perspective, long-term memory exists as nothing more than the complex consequence of this recursively generative process.
Take, for instance, the reduction of complex environments to sets of interrelated properties. This encapsulates the empirical method, 
which can be decomposed into primitive sequence operations.

<p>Taking a functional perspective of long-term memory provides the following approximate heuristic. We can imagine that each component
results from the complex composition of primitive operations acting within and between perceptual modalities.</p>

<h4>Optimisation</h4>
<p>The efficacy of cognitive function exists as the product of wave interference between sleep-wake, circasemidian, and ultradian cycles.
Additional interference is caused by physiological stress which exacerbates and prolongs both crests and trophs. Cognitive function
converts to work in the absence of interference requiring for the dilution of cognitive function. Thus, in the ideal case, a task is 
recursively broken down into subtasks, until primitive tasks are reached for which the cognitive effort required for their completion
roughly equates to the energy present within a cognitive cycle. Energy is required to context-switch between subtasks across time. 
Cues exist as momentary expenditures of energy motivating continued work towards a given subtask. For instance, the energy to open a 
notebook versus the energy to study for two hours. Chained cue-task pairs across time are a means of minimising context-switch cost.</p>

<p>Cognitive work initially motivates the learning of algorithms required to execute a given task, and in the limit, the rehearsal 
of these derived algorithms. The ratio of learning to rehearsal exponentially decreases for each instance of learning, as does the rate
of decay of learnt information. A set of learnt algorithms that are approximately maximally rehearsed can exist as input to yet to 
be derived algorithms. This recursive process of learning and rehearsal creates a series of nested s-curves. Learning and rehearsal of the
set of subtasks required for the completion of a task do not allow for its partial completion, until some threshold is reached, at which
point partial completion grows exponentially towards a plateau of total completion. This progression exists as an s-curve. Approximately
maximal rehearsal of a set of subtasks will produce total completion of the task that exists as the product of their joint rehearsal. If
dissimilar from the intended task, the initial hypothesis is adjusted, and this process repeats itself.</p>
