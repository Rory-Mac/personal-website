<h4>Memory</h4> 
<p>Memory exists as a hierarchy of encoding, decoding, storage and retrieval processes, and can be subdivided into sensory memory,
working memory and long-term memory. Sensory memory is modality-specific, seemingly exists for each sense, and is characterised by
high-resolution information that is weakly dependent on attention and shows near-immediate decay. Party sparklers leave a visible trace of
effulgence in the dark when moved quickly enough. This is the sensory trace that briefly exists in iconic memory: the visual component
of sensory memory.</p>
<p>Working memory is malleable short-term memory. Short-term memory is non-sensory memory that decays quickly without rehearsal. The
phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad is working memory operating on auditory and visuo-spatial information, respectively. 
These are the forms of working memory we are perhaps most familiar with, though working memory operates on other sensory information as 
well: proprioceptive and haptic information in the case of motor learning. Unlike sensory memory, working memory is shared as a resource
across the senses; one's performance on modality-specific memory tests will be impeded if having to play them simultaneously. Memory 
rehearsal retains information in working memory. Encoding of working memory acts to compress information to allow for more informationn 
to be manipualted simultaneously. The degree of rehearsal and encoding of information in working memory corresponds to the degree
to which that information is stored and preserved in long-term memory.</p>
<p>Long-term memory allows chunks encoded from working memory to be preserved across time, so that less energy is required to identify 
complex relationships in present information if said relationships were previously identified. The Cognitive Reflection Test is a 
good demonstration of this, containing questions that have both a more intuitive incorrect answer and a less intuitive correct
answer:  
<ul>
    <li>A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?</li>
    <li>If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?</li>
    <li>In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?</li>
</ul>
The more intuitive answer relies more upon long-term memory than working memory. The less intuitive answer relies more upon working memory
than long-term memory. The chunks restored from long-term to working memory when solving a problem exhibit a recency bias. For instance,
it is more likely that a subject fills the blank "SO__" in with "SOUP" if recently exposed to words relating to meal preparation and 
"SOAP" if recently exposed to words relating to bathroom ware. Long-term memory can be divided into implicit memory and explicit memory.
Implicit memory is memory that is implicitly known. It can be subdivided into perceptual, procedural, and associative memory. Perceptual
memory stores perceptual information: faces, voices, places, tastes, songs, etc. Procedural memory stores procedures (how to ride a bike,
how to read reversed text, etc.). Associative memory stores perceived associations (Knees, Anatomy, Skeleton, Halloween, Pumpkin, etc.). 
Explicit memory is memory that is explicitly known. It can be subdivided into episodic, semantic and autobiographical memory. Episodic
memory is long-term memory storing what was perceived in the past. Semantic memory is long-term memory storing knowledge about the world 
that has been derived from what was perceived in the past. Autobiographical memory is long-term memory storing perception of self as derived
from semantic and episodic memory. To alleviate this categorical complexity, memory can be conceptualised as an interconnected
network of networks composed of nodes and relations, with individual networks corresponding to distinct types of memory.</p>

<p>Cognitive function follows a Circasemidan rhythm that exists as the first harmonic of the sleep-wake cycle, and further interferes with
ultradian cycles of approximately two hours duration. Maximising energy to work conversion in the context of cognitive function involves
ensuring there is energy to expend, preventing interference and minimising retention cost (the cost of retaining information learnt). 
Physiological health (sleep patterns, dieting, exercise, absence of health conditions etc.,) ensures there is energy to expend on cognitive
function. Thus, it can be thought of as an up-shift/down-shift of cognitive cycles, with maximal crests and trophs existing only in good 
health. Both physiological stress and restful distraction can prolong an ultradian cycle to cause interference with subsequent cycles and
increased cognitive fatigue. Ideally, work needed to achieve a task or subtask equals cognitive output within one alertness cycle. However,
it is better to split a task into subtasks that can be resolved within one cycle, or to distribute larger self-contained tasks across
multiple cycles, rather than offsetting its earlier completion with an increase of interference between cycles. Non-interference ensures
that visual, auditory, or procedural streams of consciousness can consolidate learnt information in the rest period of rest-activity cycles.
Cognitive work is required both to learn and to retain information as learnt information is forgotten across time. Thankfully, the rate at
which information is forgotten, and thus the work required to re-obtain previously learnt information, decreases with review. Retention cost 
(work required to maintain learnt information) is minimised when learnt information is maximally associated, abstracted and combined 
with existing information. First principles analysis allows for new information to be abstracted to a point of convergence with 
existing abstract information. Thus, new information consolidates with existing information through succession of a chain of rehearsed
abstract information. Existing information can be combined to form new information.</p>

<p>Exploring the limit of these faculties of memory helps to ensure their utilisation across time. For a given cognitive task, it may not
be known whether the optimal encoding takes a visuo-spatial, auditory, haptic, or proprioceptive form, or some combination of the above.
Of the set of possible encodings, many will be absurd and few will be optimal. It seems counter-intuitive to expend energy modifying
useful and familiar heuristics into absurd forms, though this is a necessary feature of traversal towards an optimal encoding. This concept
can be applied to a socio-emotional context as well. Cognitive tasks include tasks habituated to satiate physiological needs as well as
tasks generated in response to unfamiliar or growth-oriented environments: entering new social contexts, learning new skills, ideating 
new goals, etc. Such tasks can be considered equivalent to goal-oriented procedures that are hierarchical and probabilistic in nature:
hierarchical in the sense that one will not work to realise one's best performance at a given activity if they are starving to death, and
probabilistic in the sense that cognitive work done towards a task increases probability of the realisation of its attached goal. Returning
to our consideration of limits, we can imagine a strategy in which maximal energy is put towards singular tasks to maximise probability
of their realisation, and another in which the same amount of energy is distributed across tasks. Assuming that an exponentially more 
work is required to increase probability of realisation of a more probable task (0.5-0.6 versus 0.8-0.9, for instance), it seems the optimal
strategy lies somewhere between maximal and minimal distribution of work. Not failing at desired tasks is indicative that one's strategy
is tending to much towards the former, whilst not seeing desired realisation is indicative that one's strategy is tending towards the 
latter. Like before, it is counter-intuitive to think that the presence of failure at realising a desired task is indicative of a higher
frequency of realisation of desired tasks across time, but such is necessary to ensure that an adequate distribution of cognitive work 
exists across tasks.</p>
