<h4>Functional Programming</h4>
<p>Functional Programming is a programming paradigm in which programs are constructed as a tree of functional expressions. Functional 
Programming in its purest form uses pure functions only. These are deterministic mathematical functions that derive their output solely from
their input. Side-effects and mutable state are thus minimised if not avoided entirely in the functional paradigm. Lambda calculus 
forms the basis for functional programming and is computationally equivalent to the turing machine model of computation.
Thus, any imperative program can be expressed as a functional program and vice versa. That being said, some programmatic 
tasks map more intuitively to the use of state rather than functional expression. To implement such tasks more easily without resorting 
to the use of state, functional programming borrows from category theory.</p>
