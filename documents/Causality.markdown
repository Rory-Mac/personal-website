<h4>Causality</h4>
<p>In a biological sense, knowledge exists as perceptual information stored in memory, structured as a network formed through
causal and associative relation. Knowledge of the concept of banana is linked by association to knowledge of the concept of yellow.
Knowledge of the concept of wind is linked by causation to knowledge of the concept of the tingling of skin. A more pragmatic
approach to the nature of knowledge is to form a set of assumptions regarding the nature of knowledge and then verify 
these assumptions in their application to machine learning. One such set of assumptions may be that knowledge exists as the perceptual
information stored by an agent that perceives an external environment and makes decisions in accordance with a policy designed to maximise
a given reward function. This gives rise to the notion of a Markov Agent who exists within a Markov Decision Process. Causal and 
associative networks may be overlayed onto the knowledge base of such an agent.</p>
