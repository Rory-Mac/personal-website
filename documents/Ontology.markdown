<h3>Ontology</h3>
<p>Knowledge follows from other knowledge and can be doubted. What is known to exist can be doubted to be what is known to not exist. What 
is known to not exist can be doubted to be what is known to exist.</p>

<p>To doubt some knowledge is to doubt all knowledge that follows. To doubt some knowledge from which all knowledge follows is to doubt all
knowledge. All knowledge can be doubted, and thus, all knowledge that follows from any knowledge can be doubted.</p>

<p>Existence as it is perceived can be known or doubted. To doubt one's perception of existence is to separate existence as it is to
existence as it is perceived. This creates an endless recursion of perceiving one's perception of existence. It may be the case that not 
only does existence exist external to perception, but that such an existence acts to make existence as it is perceived distinct from itself,
so that the perceiver never perceives existence as it actually is. This is Descarte's demon. Even in the presence of such a demon, it can be
known that a perceived existence is perceived to exist. Of course this notion itself is a perceived existence that can be doubted, but 
the perception itself cannot, which itself is a perceived existence that can be doubted, and so on ad nauseum. Thus, we can perceive an
endless recursion between existence as it is perceived and existence as it actually is.</p>

<p>Thus, any and all knowledge follows from the knowledge that knowledge is perceived and predicated on such perception. We can perceive 
the presence or absence of Descarte's demon, the presence or absence of an existence distinct from perceived existence, but we cannot
not perceive. And if we perceive perception itself we cannot not perceive these strange endless recursions between existence as it is 
perceived and as it is.</p>
<p>Ontological and Epistemological assumptions can be made to move towards unique and distinct domains of knowledge. Ontology is knowledge
of what exists. Epistemology is knowledge of what can be known to exist. Ontology can be objectivist in the assertion that that which
exists exists external to its perception, or subjectivist in the assertion that such does not. Epistemology can be realist in the assertion
that knowledge of an external existence can be obtained through observation, or interpretivist in the assertion that such knowledge can
only be obtained through study of both observation and observer. Assuming the nature of the world and how we can come to know of it,
we devise a set of methods for doing so. Methodologies categorise methods as being quantitiative if involving numeric data or qualitative.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/methods_of_reasoning.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>Methods include deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, the empirical method and philosophical razors. 
Deductive reasoning is reasoning that involves the application of well-defined rules to well-defined input to get a corresponding output. 
For instance, the rule may be that 'a ∈ A & A ⊆ B ⇒ a ∈ B', the input a, and the deductive inference that 'a ∈ B'. This is in contrast to 
inductive reasoning where the inference is probabilistic with respect to a perceived pattern. For instance in a 4x4 grid of shapes, if every
row thus far visited has one of each of a set of four distinct shapes, but one element of a then encountered row is hidden, the inductive 
inference would be that this element is the shape missing from the set. It may be revealed that this is not the case, but the inductive
inference can be asserted correct with respect to the pattern identified. Deductive reasoning infers a consequence from a rule and an input;
abductive reasoning infers a likely input from a rule and a consequence. For instance, from the strike of a cue ball on a pool
table one could deduce the scattering of the others. In contrast, from the scattering of the other pool balls, one could 
abduce the striking of the cue ball.</p>
<p>The empirical method can be used to identify the causal elements at play in more complex systems.
In this method, a set of elements hypothesised to be related are isolated, and then combined in a way that will confirm or
refute the hypothesised causal and correlative links. This method is philosophically objectivist and realist, but can be adapted to a
subjectivist and interpretivist framework by treating the observer as a relevant element within the studied system. Other methods for 
the acquisition of knowledge include philosophical razors: principles for the selection of certain explanations over others with regards
to the behaviour of a system. Examples include Occam's razor, Alder's razor, and Popper's falsifiability. Occam's razor
proposes that if two hypotheses exist, make the same prediction, and have equal explanatory power, the one with less elements should 
be selected for and studied further. Alder's razor proposes that a proposition is not worthy of study unless shown through the terms
of a formal language that such will have observable consequence. Popper's falsifiability criterion proposes that a proposition is not 
worthy of study unless it can be logically contradicted by an empirical test.</p>

<p>One more consequence of ontology and epistemology worthy of discussion is that of ideology. If we assume the existence of multiple 
observers each possessing knowledge structures as generated through their respective methods of inquiry, we approach the concept of 
ideology. We can think of ideology as group knowledge structures generated across observers through their shared methods of inquiry.</p>
