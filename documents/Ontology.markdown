<h3>Ontology</h3>
<p>Knowledge follows from knowledge and can be doubted. What is known to exist can be doubted to be what is known to not exist. What 
is known to not exist can be doubted to be what is known to exist.</p>

<p>To doubt some knowledge is to doubt all knowledge that follows from that knowledge. To doubt some knowledge from which all knowledge
follows is to doubt all knowledge. Any knowledge can be doubted, thus, all knowledge can be doubted.</p>

<p>There can exist knowledge from which all knowledge follows, for instance, that there exists perception of existence. 
To doubt this is to doubt the existence of one's perception, which seems immediately contradictory, and from which nothing else follows.
If instead the existence of one's perception is not doubted, all else follows: perceived existence, knowledge of perceived existence, 
knowledge of knowledge of perceived existence, ad infinitum. Nonetheless, nothing is known in such a system, save for the knowledge that
such knowledge follows from the non-doubt of one's perception of existence. It may be the case that existence exists and is perceived, or
that existence as it is perceived does not exist, or that existence exists and existence as it is perceived does not exist. This is
equivalent to Descarte's demon.</p>

<p>Thus, any and all knowledge follows from the non-doubt of doubtable knowledge. We perceive the above notions of perceived existence,
and our doubt or non-doubt dictates that which follows. Domains of knowledge emerge from the doubt or non-doubt of ontological and 
epistemological assumptions, of what exists and what is known to exist, respectively. 
Ontology is objectivist/subjectivist in the assertion/non-assertion that existence exists external to perception. Epistemology is 
realist/interpretivist in the assertion that knowledge is obtained through observation of existence, or observation of observer,
respectively. Methods exist within ontological and epistemological frameworks as procedures by which knowledge is obtained. Methodologies
categorise methods. Methods include abductive, deductive and inductive reasoning. Abduction, deduction and induction can be logically
expressed as follows.
\[ \{q, p \rightarrow q\} \rightarrow p \]
\[ \{p, p \rightarrow q\} \rightarrow q \]
\[ (p, q) \rightarrow (p \rightarrow q) \]
Take, as an example, the striking of a billiard with a cue. If the billiard is struck with a cue, the billiard is displaced. To perceive
the displacement of the billiard, and infer that it was struck with a cue, is to exercise abduction. To perceive the displacement of the 
billiard follow from it being struck with a cue, and to then perceive the billiard be struck with a cue, and infer its displacement, is
to exercise deduction. To perceive the billiard being struck with a cue, and then the displacement of the billiard, and infer that the
displacement of the billiard follows from it being struck with a cue, is to exercise induction.</p> 
<p>We can take an information processing perspective as an ontological stance, asserting the perception of existence to be akin to 
the processing of information from input to output. An algorithm is an instance of information processing from input to output, and 
computation a term for describing the information processing itself. The output of an algorithm can exist as the input to that same, or
another, algorithm, and algorithms are composable.</p>
<p>As information processing systems, there is a lot of potential compute. The notion of desire in this context can be considered the
discriminating factor between that which is and is not computed. A quinary system can be used to classify desire. In this
system there exists the primary desire to derive algorithms that maximise the positive valence of input. There then exists the secondary
desire to derive algorithms that maximise the predictive power of existing algorithms. The tertiary desire extends the secondary desire
to the context of interface between self and other. The quarternary desire extends desire to endure the negative valence of input, as does
the quinary desire but in the context of interface between self and other.</p>
