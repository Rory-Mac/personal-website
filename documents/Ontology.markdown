<h3>Ontology</h3>
<p>Inquiring into the nature of knowledge is a tricky thing. Inquiry itself is founded upon knowledge, which as the subject of the inquiry,
cannot be established. Knowledge must therefore initially be assumed, and from this assumption all else will follow. The assumption that
"existence is perceived" or that "existence exists and is perceived" can be made. If instead existence does not exist or existence is not
perceived, then everything that exists does not exist, everything that is perceived does not exist, nothing exists, and nothing else follows.
If existence does exist, then all that exists exists, and all else follows. If existence is perceived, then all that is perceived exists,
and all else follows. These initial assumptions are ontological in their relation to the nature of being, but distinct in their 
assertion that existence exists, dividing ontology into objectivism and subjectivism. The former asserts that reality exists external to
the observer, the latter asserts that it does not. Ontology inquires into the nature of what exists. Epistemology inquires into the nature 
of what can be known to exist.</p>

<p>Empiricism, rationalism, and pragmatism are examples of realist epistemology, believing that all that can be known is derived from the
senses, from reason, and from practical application of reason, respectively. A realist epistemology is an epistemology believing that 
knowledge of an external reality that exists can be obtained. Thus, a realist epistemology rests on an objectivist ontology. In contrast,
an interpretivist epistemology believes that knowledge can be obtained only through observation of the observer, not in observation itself.
It could rest on either an objectivist or subjectivist ontology. From epistemology we can migrate to methods. If epistemology inquires into
the nature of what can be known to exist, methods inquire into the nature of how we can come to know it. Deductive inference, inductive 
inference, experimental test, and case study, are all methods.</p>
<p>Methods belong to a methodology that is quantitative if dealing with numeric data and qualitative otherwise. Knowledge obtained through
these methodologies is likely to contain structural differences depending on the methodology selected. The knowledge is structural in the
sense that it exists as a network of causal and correlative relation. If we hold this as being true, then we can compare the structure of 
knowledge produced by different inquiries by comapring the complexixty of the language used to describe them. Take inquiry into 
propositional logic as an example, which involves a finite and relatively small alphabet of logical symbols, a grammar, a rule set, and 
a set of discovered expressions. In the limit, the ratio of depth to breadth is great. Take inquiry into international relations, which 
involves complex historical case study from which broader claims are made, all in natural language. In the limit of this case, the ratio
of breadth to depth is great.</p>
<p>Like other methods, the scientific method can apply a quantitative methodology, a qualititative methodology, or some hybridisation of 
the two. In its usual empirical form, the method involves observation of a phenomenon, hypothesis as to the cause of the phenomenon,
recreation of the phenomenon in the sole presence of factors hypothesised to be causal or correlative, confirmation or refutation of the
hypothesis, and the drawing of inferences from the confirmed or refuted hypothesis. In its empirical form, by assuming an external 
world exists from which we can obtain knowledge through the senses, the scientific method grounds itself in a realist epistemology and an
objectivist ontology. The same method can be appropriated for subjectivist ontologoies and non-realist epistemologies. To do so,
the base of knowledge that motivates the inquiry is evaluated in relation to the observer, by identifying the framework the observer
operates within (the ontology, epistemology, methodology, method, ideology, etc) and the effect it has over the observer's observation and
the knowledge obtained through observation.</p>
<p>If we assume the existence of multiple observers, or assume the perception of the existence of multiple observers, and assume that
these multiple observers make distinct observations and inquire into some observations and not others, then we approach the
concept of ideology. The observer can be thought to possess an ideal motivating this selectiveness. Thus, each observer possesses 
a distinct knowledge structures based upon their ideals. Ideologies exist as group knowledge structures produced by multiple 
observers sharing the same ideals. Ideals may be classed together, producing ideologies that are classed together, such as political 
ideologies pertaining to the nature of governance, economic ideologies pertaining to the nature of wealth, philosophical ideologies 
pertaining to the nature of nature, social ideologies pertaining to the nature of human interaction, or some hybridisation of the above.</p>
<p>We might then ask how this document fits within the knowledge structure it produces from its inquiry. Based on our
discussion thus far, it seems this document is objectivist, realist and rationalist, seeing as it assumes the existence of an external world
whose knowledge can be obtained through reason, specifically from the a priori assumptions that existence exists and is perceived. The
document is clearly not interpretivist or ideological, as knowledge is not obtained through reference to or analysis of the observer writing 
the document. Although the document succesfully integrates what initially seems contradictory, that knowledge requires inquiry and that
inquiry requires knowledge, it still belongs to a specific ideological path within itself. Taking an interpretivist rather than a realist
ideological path within the structure the document describes itself as belonging to, dissolves the document into noise.</p>
