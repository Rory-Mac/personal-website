<h3>Knowledge and Ideology</h3>
<p>Inquiring into the nature of knowledge is a tricky thing. Inquiry itself is founded upon knowledge, which as the subject of the inquiry,
cannot be established. Knowledge must therefore initially be assumed, and from this assumption all else will follow. The assumption that
"existence is perceived" or that "existence exists and is perceived" can be made. If instead existence does not exist or existence is not
perceived, then everything that exists does not exist, everything that is perceived does not exist, nothing exists, and nothing else follows.
If existence does exist, then all that exists exists, and all else follows. If existence is perceived, then all that is perceived exists,
and all else follows. These initial assumptions are ontological in their relation to the nature of being, but distinct in their 
assertion that existence exists, dividing ontology into objectivism and subjectivism. The former asserts that reality exists external to
the observer, the latter asserts that it does not. Ontology inquires into the nature of what exists. Epistemology inquires into the nature 
of what can be known to exist.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/research_methods.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>Empiricism, rationalism, and pragmatism are examples of realist epistemology, believing that all that can be known is derived from the
senses, from reason, and from practical application of reason, respectively. A realist epistemology is an epistemology believing that 
knowledge of an external reality that exists can be obtained. Thus, a realist epistemology rests on an objectivist ontology. In contrast,
an interpretivist epistemology believes that knowledge can be obtained only through observation of the observer, not in observation itself.
It could rest on either an objectivist or subjectivist ontology. From epistemology we can migrate to methods. If epistemology inquires into
the nature of what can be known to exist, methods inquire into the nature of how we can come to know it. Deductive inference, inductive 
inference, experimental test, and case study, are all methods.</p>
<p>Methods belong to a methodology that is quantitative if dealing with numeric data and qualitative otherwise. Knowledge obtained through
these methodologies is likely to contain structural differences depending on the methodology selected. The knowledge is structural in the
sense that it exists as a network of causal and correlative relation. If we hold this as being true, then we can compare the structure of 
knowledge produced by different inquiries by comapring the complexixty of the language used to describe them. Take inquiry into 
propositional logic as an example, which involves a finite and relatively small alphabet of logical symbols, a grammar, a rule set, and 
a set of discovered expressions. In the limit, the ratio of depth to breadth is great. Take inquiry into international relations, which 
involves complex historical case study from which broader claims are made, all in natural language. In the limit of this case, the ratio
of breadth to depth is great.</p>
<p>Like other methods, the scientific method can apply a quantitative methodology, a qualititative methodology, or some hybridisation of 
the two. In its usual empirical form, the method involves observation of a phenomenon, hypothesis as to the cause of the phenomenon,
recreation of the phenomenon in the sole presence of factors hypothesised to be causal or correlative, confirmation or refutation of the
hypothesis, and the drawing of inferences from the confirmed or refuted hypothesis. In its empirical form, by assuming an external 
world exists from which we can obtain knowledge through the senses, the scientific method grounds itself in a realist epistemology and an
objectivist ontology. The same method can be appropriated for subjectivist ontologoies and non-realist epistemologies. To do so,
the base of knowledge that motivates the inquiry is evaluated in relation to the observer, by identifying the framework the observer
operates within (the ontology, epistemology, methodology, method, ideology, etc) and the effect it has over the observer's observation and
the knowledge obtained through observation.</p>
<p>If we assume the existence of multiple observers, or assume the perception of the existence of multiple observers, and assume that
these multiple observers make distinct observations and inquire into some observations and not others, then we approach the
concept of ideology. The observer can be thought to possess an ideal motivating this selectiveness. Thus, each observer possesses 
a distinct knowledge structures based upon their ideals. Ideologies exist as group knowledge structures produced by multiple 
observers sharing the same ideals. Ideals may be classed together, producing ideologies that are classed together, such as political 
ideologies pertaining to the nature of governance, economic ideologies pertaining to the nature of wealth, philosophical ideologies 
pertaining to the nature of nature, social ideologies pertaining to the nature of human interaction, or some hybridisation of the above.</p>
<p>We might then ask how this document fits within the knowledge structure it produces from its inquiry. Based on our
discussion thus far, it seems this document is objectivist, realist and rationalist, seeing as it assumes the existence of an external world
whose knowledge can be obtained through reason, specifically from the a priori assumptions that existence exists and is perceived. The
document is clearly not interpretivist or ideological, as knowledge is not obtained through reference to or analysis of the observer writing 
the document. Although the document succesfully integrates what initially seems contradictory, that knowledge requires inquiry and that
inquiry requires knowledge, it still belongs to a specific ideological path within itself. Taking an interpretivist rather than a realist
ideological path within the structure the document describes itself as belonging to, dissolves the document into noise.</p>
<h3>Realism</h3>
<p>The rest of this document will explore a subset of ideologies of personal interest, looking to the assumptions they make and the 
heuristics they use, starting with Realism. Realism is a school of thought in international relations that inquires into the nature of
governance at the international level. Realism can be characterised by the following principles:
<ul>State-centrism: international relations exist as the product of the interaction between states, defined as human collectives
under singular systems of governance.</ul>
<ul>Anarchy: no supranational authority exists, thus the system of state relations is anarchic in nature.</ul>
<ul>Rationality: states are rational actors, acting in accordance with a self-interest.</ul>
<ul>Power: of primary self-interest to a state is power for the purpose of self-preservation</ul>
Realist thought is closely tied to geopolitics: the analysis of the effect of Earth's geography on international relations. 
To understand the realist view of the international order as state-centric and anarchic, it helps to first understand the role geography
plays in the establishment and development of civilisation. To understand the realist view of states as rational power-driven actors,
it helps to look more closely at the organisational structures underlying their governance.</p>
<h4>Geographical influence on the beginnings of civilisation</h4>
<p>Imagine a map of the world today. The most objective components of this map, prior to the drawing of any geographical lines, 
are the features of the Earth itself, the continents, oceans, biomes, mountains and river systems. We as humans seek regions of 
abundance. Abundance gives us satiation in the short-term, through the availability of needed resources, and growth in the long-term,
by allowing energy to be expended on the discovery and development of new cultural and technological practices. The cradles of civilisation,
of which there are six, are the civilisations that emerged naturally from the developing practices of nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes. All
cradles of civilisation emerged in regions of abundance, and were characterised by agriculture, urban-dwellings, monument erection and use
of the written word. This includes Ancient Mesopotamia and the fertile crescent, Ancient Egypt and the Nile, Ancient India, the
Indus and the Ghaggar-Hakra, Ancient China and the Yellow River, the Caral-Supe and the Fortaleza, the Pativilica and the Supe, and finally,
the Olmecs and the tropical lowlands of the gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>These river systems and coastal regions gave humans a reliable source of aquatic food, wildlife, and alluvial soil for agriculture. 
They also provided a means of transport, allowing humans to expand across a coast or river bank whilst maintaining a communal identity 
through frequent trade and travel. Other candidates for early civilisation may never have been realised due to a number of preventative
factors, including geographic isolation, harsh ecologies and temperamental climates (discouraging labor-intensive agricultural practice),
mountainous topographies (causing low population density that discourages urbanisation), and regions of frequent natural disaster.</p>
<p><img src="/Assets/images/compounding_culture.png" width="100%" height="100%"></p>
<p>Within these cradles of civilisation, cultural knowledge grew exponentially with respect to the number of generations for
which the knowledge was preserved, inherited and extended upon. The Sumerians of Ancient Mesopotamia developed the wheel, the sail, 
irrigation techniques, cuneiform literature, ziggurat temples, and social stratification (upper, middle, lower and enslaved). The Ancient
Egyptians, used pulleys, ramps and levers, developed papyrus paper, pottery
and rope trusses, and erected Abu Simbel, the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids. Despite the grandeur of these past cradles of civilisations, they, like all
others across human history, were subject to atrophy and strain in the form of war, plague, famine, and natural disaster.</p>
<p>The Three Kingdoms War of early China saw some 36 to 40 million people killed from conflict, famine and disease, approximately 20% of
the global population at the time<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>. The black death was estimated to have caused 75 to 200 million fatalities, and the plague of Justinian wiped
out 25%-60% of European inhabitants<sup>[4]</sup>. The Yellow River flood killed an estimated 2,000,000 people and the Bhola Cycle of East Pakistan/West
India an estimated 500,000 people<sup>[5]</sup></p>
<p>It is clear that human history has been shaped and punctuated by mass death and suffering across
nations and empires that form and stay bound through national, ethnic and religious identity. The fierceness of their competititon derives
from their military, industrial and political strength, making for a continual power struggle by which geographic lines are drawn and 
redrawn across history. With this, we arrive at our first heuristic: the natural world's geopolitical overlay, comprised of amoeboid like
nation-states<sup>[6][7]</sup> that rise and fall, spread and recede, fragment and combine.</p>
<h4>Geographical influence on modern civilisation</h4>
<p>Despite the sophistication of modern technology, the geographical features of a state still contribute greatly to its strategic mindset
and it operational capabilities. Consider that natural events such as sandstorms and heavy rain can render constellations of surveillance
satellites of the world's greatest powers as useless. Let us look to a number of examples of the influence geography holds over modern
states, starting with Russia.</p>
<p>Russia is the largest country in the world, spanning eleven time zones from Western Europe to Northern Asia. Siberia, the largest region
of Russia, encompasses most of Northern Asia and comprises approximately three quarters of Russian territory but only one quarter of its
population. The Ural Mountains separate Siberia from the rest of Russia, which is instead seated atop the Great European Plain, a biome 
that makes Russia geographically vulnerable to ground invasion by neighbouring states. Moscow, the Russian capital, is at times referred
to as the port of the five seas, seeing as the Moscow Canal connects the Moskva and the Volga river systems with maritime routes to the
White Sea, Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea. Returning to consideration against a ground invasion, it is in the 
best interests of Moscow to control the leg of the Great European Plain east of the Carpathian Mountains, and the wedge formed by such
a plain, as it did through the Warsaw Pact at the time of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Let us now look to the arctic, a region whoses geographical signficance will only increase as net global temperatures do, and whose
control will be vied for by neighbouring states in the coming decades. As net temperatures increase, previously undiscovered or 
inaccessible resources will reveal themselves for greater periods of the year as will the number of international maritime trade routes
that wind through this region. These routes include the Northwest passage that lines North America, the Northern Sea Route that lines 
Northern Russia, and the Transpolar Sea Route that routes from the atlantic to the pacific ocean. Cargo ships coming from the Red Sea 
directed towards the Panama Canal can be redirected through these tranpolar routes, saving weeks in transit time. The states encircling
the arctic region, namely Canada, the United States, Iceland, Russia, Norway, and Denmark (via Greenland), do not have obvious claims
to arctic territory. This is furthered by the fact that the continental shelves of the continents to which these states belong, drop off
before touching any such territory.</p>
<h4>Structures of Governance</h4>
<p>A structure of governance, not unlike an organisational structure, is a structure that defines the way in which work and decision-making
is delegated to subcomponents of a collective group of individuals. These human collectives can be
thought of as organisms, which disintegrate under the weight of external selective pressures if not specialised for stability and expansion.
As humans, we are primed to want for social cohesion for the sake of our own survival, motivating the emergence of these communal structures,
which offer a wealth of cultural knowledge, economic opportunity in trade, and safety in numbers. These group identities scale from the 
local to the global, from a sense of self that relates to one's friends, family, colleagues, etc, to a sense of self that relates to one's 
nationality, ethnicity, social class, religion, etc.</p>
<p>Organisms evolve to embody a form that maximises the likelihood of their survival and proliferation, and will thus engage in predation,
parasitism and symbiosis. States evolve to embody a form that will maximise the likelihood of their stability and expansion, and will thus engage in both mutually
beneficial and conflict-based relations with foreign entities. We can define a state as a human collective that exists under a
singular system of governance. At all levels, entities with selectively advantageous traits will be promoted.
Social norms promote the authority of individuals with skills and charactersitics of perceived value. Monetary flow promotes the  
authority of businesses and organisations that provide the most value or create the most economic dependence.</p>
<p>In abstract terms, a state has a system of governance, governing a labor force, enforced by internal policing, to seek foreign 
opportunities, safe-guarded by military might. The degree of coupling between a state and its subcomponents becomes problematic
if too weak or too strong, devolving into tyranny, bureaucracy, military coups, widespread protest, etc. 
State military may exist as a combination of national forces, civilian militia and private contractors. 
Industry may be predominantly onshore or offshore, with the balance of net importation and exportation providing 
an economic profile of dependencies between states<sup>[8]</sup>. There will also exist some apparatus for the dissemination of information where the struggle for hearts and minds takes place. In the modern world, this occurs over news broadcast, social media, and the
internet. This information may be natural in the form of competing perspectives on current issues, or artificial in the form of
advertisement and propaganda.</p>
