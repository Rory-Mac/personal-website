<h4>Game Theory</h4>
<p>Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions. The Prisoner's Dilemma is a thought experiment that acts as 
a great introduction into the field of game theory. In this experiment...

Discuss
    Action, Strategy
    Prisoner's dilemma
    Cake-cutting Game (external force as determinant of cooperative vs non-cooperative game)
    Ultimatum Game (number 42, what if wife/child gave 10/0 split and you still accepted)
    Goalie and Kicker (pure strategies, mixed strategies, equilibria)
    Global Thermonuclear War
    First simulation (strategies, indicators, resources)
    Does prospect theory complicate matters?
    

Split or Steal
Strategies (takers, givers, grudgers, copycats, detective)
Variables that can change (rewards/punishments, number of interactions, number of rounds, rules of proliferation, mistakes)
Other: Nash Equilibirum, Social Contract, Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)
